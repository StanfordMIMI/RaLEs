However, the mechanism of the interaction between functionalized TiO2 and biomolecules, especially how the modified TiO2 regulates subsequent protein functions, still needs further investigation. In this study, we studied the interaction of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) with hydroxyl- and phosphite-grafted TiO2 surfaces.

Grafting phosphite groups on the surface of TiO2 can significantly increase the adsorption energy of the protein and change the orientation of BMP-2 so that the wrist epitope of the BMP-2 molecules is pointing upward.

    "            A recently developed GAN-based vocoder, MelGAN, produces speech waveforms in real-time. \n",
    "            However, it often produces a waveform that is insufficient in quality or inconsistent \n",
    "            with acoustic characteristics of the input mel spectrogram. \n",
    "            VocGAN is nearly as fast as MelGAN, but it significantly improves the quality and consistency of the output waveform. \n",
    "            VocGAN applies a multi-scale waveform generator and a hierarchically-nested discriminator to learn multiple levels of acoustic properties in a balanced way. \n",
    "            It also applies the joint conditional and unconditional objective, which has shown successful results in high-resolution image synthesis. \n",
    "            In experiments, VocGAN synthesizes speech waveforms 416.7x faster on a GTX 1080Ti GPU and 3.24x faster on a CPU than realtime. \n",
    "            Compared with MelGAN, it also exhibits significantly improved quality in multiple evaluation metrics including mean opinion score (MOS) with minimal additional overhead. \n",
    "            Additionally, compared with Parallel WaveGAN, another recently developed high-fidelity vocoder, VocGAN is 6.98x faster on a CPU and exhibits higher MOS.\n",

A recently developed GAN-based vocoder, MelGAN, produces speech waveforms in real-time. However, it often produces a waveform that is insufficient in quality or inconsistent with acoustic characteristics of the input mel spectrogram. VocGAN is nearly as fast as MelGAN, but it significantly improves the quality and consistency of the output waveform. VocGAN applies a multi-scale waveform generator and a hierarchically-nested discriminator to learn multiple levels of acoustic properties in a balanced way. It also applies the joint conditional and unconditional objective, which has shown successful results in high-resolution image synthesis. In experiments, VocGAN synthesizes speech waveforms 416.7x faster on a GTX 1080Ti GPU and 3.24x faster on a CPU than realtime. Compared with MelGAN, it also exhibits significantly improved quality in multiple evaluation metrics including mean opinion score (MOS) with minimal additional overhead.

      "Functionalized TiO2 surfaces facilitate selective receptor-recognition and modulate biological function of bone norphogenetic protein-2. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a promising biomedical material because it can be modified with various functional groups. However, the mechanism of the interaction between functionalized TiO2 and biomolecules, especially how the modified TiO2 regulates subsequent protein functions, still needs further investigation. In this study, we studied the interaction of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) with hydroxyl- and phosphite-grafted TiO2 surfaces. A set of force field parameters was developed for hydroxyl and phosphite groups on TiO2 surfaces, and the adsorption energy between the surface of the functionalized TiO2 and BMP-2 was calculated. Different coverages of functional groups were applied to the surface to investigate the influence of the functional group density. Grafting phosphite groups on the surface of TiO2 can significantly increase the adsorption energy of the protein and change the orientation of BMP-2 so that the wrist epitope of the BMP-2 molecules is pointing upward. This configuration specifically binds to the BMP receptor type-I on the cell membrane and activates the SMAD1/5/8 signaling pathway for the purpose of enhancing the expression of bone growth and regeneration-related protein. This study shows that it is possible to regulate the function of a protein by deliberately modifying the material surface, which can guide the design of new materials through function-oriented surface modification.\n",

      "Fully automated synthetic chemistry would significantly change the field by providing access to small molecules for any lab with the right equipment. However, the reactions that can be run autonomously are still somewhat limited. Automating the stereospecific assembly of Csp3–C bonds would significantly expand access to functional organic molecules1. Previously, methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA) boronates were used to orchestrate the formation of Csp2-Csp2 bonds and were effective building blocks for automating the synthesis of many small molecules2, but are incompatible with stereospecific Csp3-Csp2 and Csp3-Csp3 bond forming reactions3–10. Here we report that hyperconjugative and steric tuning gave a new class of tetramethyl N-methyliminodiacetic acid (TIDA) boronates that are stable to these conditions. Charge density analysis11–13 revealed redistribution of electron density increases covalency of the N–B bond and thereby attenuates its hydrolysis. Complementary steric shielding of carbonyl π-faces decreases reactivity toward nucleophilic reagents. The unique features of the iminodiacetic acid cage2 essential for generalized automated synthesis are retained by TIDA boronates. This allowed Csp3 boronate building blocks to be assembled using automated synthesis, including the preparation of natural products through automated stereospecific Csp3-Csp2 and Csp3-Csp3 bond formation. These findings will enable increasingly complex Csp3-rich small molecules to be accessed via automated assembly.\n",
