    "            We present a novel high-fidelity real-time neural vocoder called VocGAN. \n",
    "            A recently developed GAN-based vocoder, MelGAN, produces speech waveforms in real-time. \n",
    "            However, it often produces a waveform that is insufficient in quality or inconsistent \n",
    "            with acoustic characteristics of the input mel spectrogram. \n",
    "            VocGAN is nearly as fast as MelGAN, but it significantly improves the quality and consistency of the output waveform. \n",
    "            VocGAN applies a multi-scale waveform generator and a hierarchically-nested discriminator to learn multiple levels of acoustic properties in a balanced way. \n",
    "            It also applies the joint conditional and unconditional objective, which has shown successful results in high-resolution image synthesis. \n",
    "            In experiments, VocGAN synthesizes speech waveforms 416.7x faster on a GTX 1080Ti GPU and 3.24x faster on a CPU than realtime. \n",
    "            Compared with MelGAN, it also exhibits significantly improved quality in multiple evaluation metrics including mean opinion score (MOS) with minimal additional overhead. \n",
    "            Additionally, compared with Parallel WaveGAN, another recently developed high-fidelity vocoder, VocGAN is 6.98x faster on a CPU and exhibits higher MOS.\"\"\"\n",
