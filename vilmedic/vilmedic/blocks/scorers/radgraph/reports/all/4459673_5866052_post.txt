FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal no evidence of axillary or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  
There is decreased T1 signal within the bilateral proximal humeri 
suggestive of red marrow hyperplasia most likely treatment related.
 
 
The left breast is composed of predominantly fatty tissue with 
minimal scattered foci of background enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
There are no obvious masses within the localizer images.
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
There is minimal susceptibility artifact seen at the site of prior 
MRI biopsy site just posterior to the areolar region.  This region 
was biopsy proven periductal inflammation.  
 
The prior large enhancing mass within the left breast demonstrates 
marked decrease in size.  There is only an 8-mm residual focus within 
the lateral aspect of the left breast demonstrating gradual 
enhancement.  This region appears to correspond to patient's known 
prior mass site.
 
Slight increased signal seen within the pre-and the post images 
within the duct-like structures of the left breast most likely 
representing protein containing debris within the ducts.  No obvious 
enhancement of these structures.
