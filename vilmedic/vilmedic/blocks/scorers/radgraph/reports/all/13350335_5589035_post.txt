FINDINGS: 
 
Limited diagnostic quality of this scan, due to patient motion, 
patient body habitus, and inability to obtain uniform RF excitation 
given the very large breast size.
 
 
Fatty breasts with minimal background enhancement.
 
 
Decreased size of an abnormal appearing right axillary lymph node 
which now measures 9 mm (series 1, image 11, SL S30), from 22 mm on 
12/8/09 MRI (SL S15).
 
 
Decreased size of abnormal enhancement at the site of the patient's 
known biopsy-proven malignancy in the outer right breast, at 9:00 
o'clock, 11 cm from the nipple, which now measures 8 x 7 mm (series 
7, image 271, SL S20.7) from 37 x 25 mm on 12/8/09 MRI (SL I 4.2). 
Associated residual T2 STIR high signal suggestive of fibrosis or 
scar now measures 6 x 13 mm (series 3, image 10, SL R131.5) from 35 x 
24 mm on 12/8/09 MRI.
 
 
Signal void from post-biopsy metal marker is noted at the anterior, 
lateral, and superior aspect of the residual enhancement at the site 
of index cancer (series 1, image 11, SL S30).
