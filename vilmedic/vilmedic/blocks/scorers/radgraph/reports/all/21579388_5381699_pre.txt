FINDINGS:  Digital images from a bilateral breast MRI performed on 
04/14 at California Pacific Medical Center are submitted for 
interpretation.  The sequences provided include three-plane 
localizer, right breast sagittal STIR and T1-weighted spin echo 
images, left breast sagittal STIR and T1-weighted images, bilateral 
sagittal fat suppressed gradient echo 3D images pre and dynamically 
during bolus injection of contrast agent.  
  
 No abnormally enlarged lymph nodes are identified. 
  
 There is an irregular 13 x 22 mm mass in the upper outer quadrant of 
the right breast seen well, for example, as an enhancing abnormality 
on series 9, image 176.  The mass is in approximately at the 10 
o'clock position, 7 cm from the nipple.  Low signal within the center 
of it likely corresponds to a biopsy clip without significant 
hematoma.  
  
 On dynamic imaging, the mass enhances extremely rapidly followed by 
a plateau with slight wash-out of contrast material.  No other foci 
of abnormal contrast enhancement are identified.
