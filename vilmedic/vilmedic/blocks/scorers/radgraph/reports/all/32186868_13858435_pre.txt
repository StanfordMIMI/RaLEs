FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of scattered fibroglandular tissue with minimal background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST:
R1: At 12 o'clock, anterior depth, 4 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with spiculated margins, and homogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 4.6 TR by 3.1 AP by 3.6 CC cm that has clumped non-mass enhancement that extends to the nipple best seen on sagittal series 2352 image 135, and measuring 4 cm in size . Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The main mass is best seen on axial peak contrast series 23,  image 1951. There are several subcentimeter satellite lesions around this mass extending up to 1 cm posteriorly (series 23 image 1950) and up to 4 cm inferiorly with a subcentimeter satellite lesion near the base of the superior aspect of the areola (series 23, image 1976). 
Including the right breast mass, adjacent subcentimeter masses and the nonmass enhancement extending towards the nipple the entire area of suspicious findings worrisome for malignancy measures 8 cm superior to inferior, 5.2 anterior posterior and 4 cm medial to lateral, as shown on axial series 23 image 1949 and sagittal series 2352 image 136.
R2: At 11 o'clock, posterior depth, 9 cm from the nipple, there is an oval mass with irregular margins, and homogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 0.6 TR by 0.9 AP by 1.1 CC cm. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on axial peak contrast series 23,  image 1939. There is a small 2 mm satellite lesion anterosuperior to this mass (series 23, image 1920/series 2352, image 155). In addition, there is a small T2 hyperintense intramammary lymph node just superior to this area (series 23, image 1914).
 
There are a few prominent right level 1 axillary lymph nodes compatible with lymphadenopathy including a markedly enlarged right level 1 axillary lymph node measuring 1.8 x 1.8 x 3.5 cm with thickened cortex (series 23, image 1940). In addition, a few small right level 2 axillary lymph nodes are visualized (series 23, image 1920). These are worrisome for metastatic disease.
There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
