FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal stable sub-centimeter size of left axillary lymph nodes.
 
The breasts are composed of heterogeneously dense tissue with mild 
background enhancement.  Again seen are scattered cysts in both 
breasts, unchanged. 
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
There has been no significant interval change in the area of clumped 
enhancement in the right breast at two o'clock, 7.5-cm from the 
nipple, in the area corresponding to the patient's known right breast 
cancer.  The area of enhancement now measures approximately 3.5 x 1.5 
cm and demonstrates slow enhancement with plateau kinetics, 
susceptibility artifact is seen within the area of enhancement, 
corresponding to the post biopsy metal marker.  Elsewhere, there are 
a few nonspecific enhancing foci.  
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
There has been a slight interval decrease in size of the patient's 
regularly enhancing mass in the left breast at 12 o'clock, 6.4-cm 
from the nipple, in the area corresponding to the patient's known 
left breast cancer.  The area of enhancement now measures 
approximately 2.7 x 1.6 cm (previously 2.7 x 2.2 cm) and demonstrates 
rapid enhancement and rapid washout kinetics.  Again seen are two 
foci of susceptibility artifact, corresponding to the patient's 
postbiopsy metal markers.  A subcentimeter nodule in the medial 
portion of the left breast, seen on the prior exam, is no longer seen 
on the current exam.
