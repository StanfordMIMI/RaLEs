FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of extreme fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST:
L1: At 11 o'clock, middle depth, 3.5 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with irregular margins, and heterogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 2.1 cm AP x 2.4 cm RL x  2.8 cm SI. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on series 23,  image 1942. There is a biopsy marker clip located within the medial aspect of the mass. 
L2: There is a biopsy marker clip located at 9:00, posterior, 6 cm from the nipple at site of biopsy-proven DCIS without an associated MR finding.
There is a biopsy marker clip located within a normal lymph node in the left axilla at 1:00, 12 cm from the nipple from prior benign biopsy.
 There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
