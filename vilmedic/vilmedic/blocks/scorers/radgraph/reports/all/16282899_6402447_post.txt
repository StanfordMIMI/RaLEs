FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes or remarkable 
extramammary regional structures.
 
The breasts are composed of dense tissue with very minimal scattered 
foci of background enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
There are no areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to 
suggest invasive malignancy. 
 
The index mass ( R1) and the previously noted 3.0 x 1.5 cm area of 
non-masslike enhancement adjacent to the index cancer in the upper 
outer quadrant of the right breast at the 10:00 position 6 cm from 
the nipple is not seen on today's exam. Artifact is seen within the 
posterior lateral portion of the right breast at the 10 o'clock 
position corresponding to the biopsy marker.
 
There is a stable 8mm circumscribed T2 intense mass within the 
inferior medial portion of the right breast at the 5 o'clock position 
3.5 cm from the nipple which shows no enhancement on post gadolinium 
images.  This is consistent with a stable cyst which is best seen on 
T2 series 3, image 34, slice locator I 61.2.  
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
There are no areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to 
suggest invasive malignancy.  A biopsy marker is seen within the 
posterior lateral portion of the left breast in the location of the 
previous benign MRI guided biopsy.
