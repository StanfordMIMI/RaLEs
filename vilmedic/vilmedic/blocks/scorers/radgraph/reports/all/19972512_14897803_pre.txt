FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of scattered fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: At 10:00, 7 cm from the nipple, there is a multilobulated irregular mass with irregular margins that measures 2.2 x 3.7 x 3.7 cm (transverse, AP, CC). There is a biopsy marker in the superolateral and inferomedial aspects reflecting the 2 ultrasound-guided biopsies that returned malignancy. The finding is best visualized on series 24, images 1929-1958. Worst curve kinetics are initial phase fast, delayed phase washout.
R2: At 9:30, 5 cm from the nipple, there is a oval spiculated mass that measures 1.4 x 0.7 x 1.3 cm. This is best seen on series 24, image 1963. Worst curve kinetics are initial phase fast, delayed phase washout. This is 1.3 cm anterior/inferior from R1. 
R3: At 9:30, 5 cm from the nipple, 0.9 cm inferior and medial from the R2 finding, there is a 0.6 cm round spiculated mass. This is best seen on series 24, image 1971. Worst curve kinetics are initial phase fast, delayed phase washout.
Including the R1, R2, and R3 masses, the segment of breast involved measures 3.7 x 6.6 x 4.0 cm (transverse, AP, CC). This is best appreciated on the MIP reconstructions.
Abnormal right axillary lymph node at the junction of level 1/2, that measures 1.1 cm (series 2, image 42). This corresponds to the ultrasound finding at 10:00, 12 cm from the nipple.
LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
