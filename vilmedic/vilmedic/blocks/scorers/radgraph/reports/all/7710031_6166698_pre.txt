FINDINGS: 
 
OUTSIDE MAMMOGRAM: The outside mammogram shows that the breast tissue 
is dense, which decreases mammographic sensitivity.
 
There is a triangle-shaped skin marker indicating a palpable 
abnormality in the right breast, slightly upper, slightly outer 
position. Spot compression views demonstrate suggestion of a mass in 
the central right breast underlying this marker.  Elsewhere, both 
breasts are negative.
 
Postbiopsy mammograms show that a postbiopsy marker is displaced 
anterolaterally, which is better described on MRI.
 
OUTSIDE ULTRASOUND: The outside ultrasound shows a 2.5 x 1.8 x 2.1 cm 
irregular hypoechoic mass labeled right breast, 9 o'clock position, 
areolar. Subsequent ultrasound shows this mass undergoing biopsy.
 
Two images of the right axilla do not demonstrate abnormal appearing 
lymph nodes.
 
OUTSIDE BREAST MRI: 
 
There is a 10 x 16 mm prominent lymph node with cortical thickening 
in the right axilla, series 200, image 75, slice locator 69.7. It is 
asymmetrically larger than the left axillary lymph nodes.
 
Incidentally seen is enhancement of the anterior right lung base, 
likely representing atelectasis or scarring.
 
The breasts are composed of dense tissue with minimal background 
enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
There is a 1.8 x 2.9 x 2.2 cm irregular enhancing mass with central 
T1 hypointensity in the central right breast, 4.5 cm from the nipple, 
series 103, image 89, slice locator 72.9. The postbiopsy marker is 
2.7 cm anterolateral to the edge of the mass, series 200, image 43, 
slice locator 5.7.
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
There are no areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to 
suggest invasive malignancy.
