FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes or remarkable 
extramammary regional structures.
 
The breasts are composed of heterogeneously dense tissue with minimal 
background enhancement, which is significantly decreased compared to 
prior exam.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
There has been interval resolution of the previously seen several 
irregular mass throughout all 4 quadrants of the right breast present 
on prior MRI dated 1/24/2012.  There are a few small scattered foci 
of nonspecific gradual enhancement.  There are no new areas of 
suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to suggest invasive 
malignancy. The known 2.0-cm mass in the 11:30 o'clock position 4 cm 
from the nipple, corresponding to biopsy-proven malignancy, seen on 
ultrasound performed yesterday is not visualized. There are a few 
small cysts in the right breast which measure up to 1cm. 
 
Three post biopsy metal markers are again seen in the lower inner 
quadrant of the right breast without associated abnormal enhancement.
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
There are no areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to 
suggest invasive malignancy. There are a few small less than 5 mm 
scattered foci of gradual enhancement.
