FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with minimal background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST AND REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: 
There is an intact subpectoral silicone implant. There is no periimplant fluid.
R1, R2, R3 and R5:  These will now in aggregate be designated R1, as there are multiple overlapping findings. At the site of biopsy-proven malignancy, extending from 7:00 to 9:00, anteriorly 1.0 cm from the nipple and posteriorly 0.2 cm from the underlying implant, there are adjacent masses and nonmass enhancement, in total spanning 4.7 cm AP by 3.4 cm RL by 1.6 cm SI (previously approximately 10.0 cm AP by 4.5 cm RL by 4.6 cm SI).  There is a Twirl biopsy marker in the 7:00 4 cm from the nipple component, which is the inferior margin of the MRI findings.
R4: The 3-4:00 3-4 cm from the nipple MRI nonmass enhancement is no longer present.
Biopsy-proven metastatic axillary lymph nodes: The previously abnormal-appearing right level 1 lymph nodes have significantly decreased in size, and are now near-normal in appearance. There is a Scout marker in one of the level 1 axillary lymph nodes (series 23 image 1996), and tattoo ink was also placed in/at this lymph node. The previously abnormal-appearing level 2 and 3 axillary lymph nodes are no longer seen.
There is a stable 0.3 cm right internal mammary node (series 23 image 1989).
There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST AND REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: 
There is an intact subpectoral silicone implant. There is no periimplant fluid.
There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
