FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal a slightly enlarged right axillary lymph node measuring 
10 mm short-axis best seen on series 3 images 89.
 
The breasts are composed of heterogeneously dense tissue with 
moderate regional background enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
"R1": There is a 2.2 cm diameter lobulated mass with very rapid rim 
enhancement, and enhancing internal septations.  This also has some 
central less rapidly enhancing areas, and small cystic components.  
Overall, however, the T2 signal intensity is only slightly higher 
than glandular tissue, not as high as a cyst or fibroadenoma.  
Restricted diffusion is noted.  This mass has very fast wash-in 
kinetic followed by slight early wash-out.
 
No other areas of abnormal enhancement.  Overall relatively diffuse  
gradual non-mass-like enhancement is likely background.
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
There are no areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to 
suggest invasive malignancy.
