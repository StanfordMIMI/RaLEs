FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST:
L1: At 1 o'clock, middle depth, 4 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with spiculated margins, and homogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 4.6 x 2.6 x 2.2 cm . The While this may represent 2 adjacent irregular masses however, there is apparent contiguity of contrast enhancement noted on series 23 images 1952 and 1953. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on axial peak contrast series 23,  image 1948 and on sagittal precontrast series 2353 image 125. There is a biopsy marker clip located within the superior aspect of the mass.
There is level 1 and level 2 left axillary lymphadenopathy spanning approximately 5.8 cm. Best seen on series 2 image 33.
 There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
