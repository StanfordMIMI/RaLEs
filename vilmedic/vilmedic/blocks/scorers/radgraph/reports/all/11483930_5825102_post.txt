FINDINGS:
 
There are several rounded low T1 and high T2 signal structures within 
both lobes of the liver, largest measuring 1.8 cm in the right lobe, 
compatible hepatic cysts.
 
The breasts are composed of dense tissue with mild scattered     
background enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
   R1: Ill-defined area of mass enhancement at the 9 o'clock position 
seen on 7/27/10 MR is not appreciated on today's examination.
 
R2: Stable 5 mm ovoid enhancing mass, 2.2 cm from the nipple seen on 
series 8, image 34, SL R67.9, is stable, and probably a fibroadenoma.
 
R3: Focus of enhancement at  the 3 oclock position, is slightly less 
conspicuous compared to the prior MRI, and is also probably benign.
 
A single focus of rapid enhancement is seen on series 8, image 29, SL 
R75.9, not present on 7/9/10 MR but given the clinical scenario, 
likely is benign physiologic enhancement. 
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
L1: There is marked response to chemotherapy at the index malignancy. 
A metal marker is seen on series 8, image 128, SL L82.5 in the upper 
outer quadrant corresponding to the index tumor. There is a 4mm 
enhancing satellite lesion just superior and medial to the marker 
clip, measuring 3.7 cm from the nipple.  
 
L2: At 12 mm anterior to the clip is a 11 x 10 x 14 mm focal area of 
gradual enhancement which is suspicious for residual DCIS or tumor.
