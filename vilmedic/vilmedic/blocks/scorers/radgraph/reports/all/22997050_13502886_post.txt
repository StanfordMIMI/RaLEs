FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of scattered fibroglandular tissue with minimal background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST:
R1: At retroareolar/central, middle depth, there is an irregular mass with spiculated margins, and homogeneous internal enhancement, which has decreased in size. The mass measures 1.4 cm AP x 1.0 cm RL x 1.1 cm SI (previously measured 1.8 x 1.5 x 2.0 cm). Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on axial peak contrast series 27,  image 1971. The (bar-shaped) biopsy marker clip is in the inferior medial aspect of the mass. 
There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: There is a left chest port.
