FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of extreme fibroglandular tissue with marked background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: Irregular, enhancing mass centered in the upper outer right breast, mid to posterior depth, measuring approximately 3.2 x 4.4 x 5.8 cm (best seen on series 23, image 1938), which abuts the lateral breast skin surface without visible fat plane (series 23, image 1939), although without definite skin thickening or retraction. The mass demonstrates internal heterogeneity, with 1.3 cm T2 hyperintensity along the superolateral aspect (series 3, image 64), which may reflect necrosis or postbiopsy hematoma. 1.7 cm nonenhancing area centrally within the mass correlates with area of dystrophic calcifications seen on prior mammogram (series 23, image 1942). Susceptibility artifact along the inferolateral/anterior aspect of the mass correlates with biopsy marker clip seen on prior mammogram (series 2, image 78). Additional scattered areas of susceptibility artifact likely correlating with calcifications on prior mammogram.
Given the extent of marked background enhancement, it is difficult to assess for satellite, multifocal, or multicentric disease. However, given the similar appearance of the contralateral breast, there are no obvious findings to suggest multifocal or multicentric disease.
Mildly asymmetric prominent right axillary lymph nodes.
LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: T2 hyperintense lesion in a mid thoracic vertebral body measuring 0.8 cm, incompletely evaluated, but likely vertebral hemangiomas.
