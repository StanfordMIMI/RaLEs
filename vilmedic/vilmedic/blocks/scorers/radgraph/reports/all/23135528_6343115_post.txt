FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes or remarkable 
extramammary regional structures. There is been marked interval 
decrease in all previously seen enlarged left axillary and 
interpectoral lymph nodes, which are now normal in size, measuring up 
to 7mm. 
 
The breasts are composed of predominantly fatty tissue with no 
background enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
There are no areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to 
suggest invasive malignancy.
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
There has been marked interval decrease in previously seen abnormal 
enhancement in the upper inner portion of the left breast. No 
residual enhancement remains.
