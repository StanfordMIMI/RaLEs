FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with moderate background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: There is near complete resolution of the extensive nonmass enhancement previously described in all 4 quadrants of the RIGHT breast with a persistent 0.7 AP by 0.7 TR by 0.7 CC centimeter focus of nonmass enhancement at the 12:00 position, 4.8 cm from the nipple (series 23, image 1952/series 32200, image 80). There is redemonstration of marker clips at the 10:00 and 11:00 positions, middle depth.
Stable oval mass is present in the deep central aspect of the breast, unchanged mammographically for greater than 2 years and therefore considered benign.
There is a marker clip in a RIGHT axillary lymph node which was positive for metastatic carcinoma on biopsy. This lymph node currently has a normal morphology, having significantly decreased in size when compared to prior examination. The cortex is now within normal limits demonstrating 1 mm thickness. There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy. 
LEFT BREAST: There is a marker clip in the LEFT breast at the 12:00 position, middle depth, at the site of biopsy-proven ADH with some surrounding fluid and enhancement, which could be secondary to postbiopsy inflammatory changes. There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: Catheter tubing is visualized with its tip in the SVC.
