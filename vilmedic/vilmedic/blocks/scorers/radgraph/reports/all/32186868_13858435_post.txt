FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of scattered fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: There is mild decrease in size of the dominant irregular spiculated mass at 12:00, centered 4 cm from the nipple, which including small adjacent satellite masses and nonmass enhancement measures 6.1 x 3.9 x 2.3 cm (AP, transverse, CC). The most anterior satellite lesion is 0.9 cm from the nipple. There is a SaviScout marker at the superior/anterior aspect of the mass, as well as a SaviScout marker marking the posterior extent of enhancement. Of note, the nonmass enhancement/satellite lesions extends another 3.9 cm anteroinferior from the anteriormost SaviScout marker and is approximately 0.6 cm from the overlying skin.  The dominant mass is best visualized on series 23, image 1930, while the most anterior area of enhancement is best visualized on series 23, and 1949.
There is no evidence of skin, nipple, or pectoralis involvement.
R2: The biopsy-proven malignant axillary tail mass at 10:30, 12 cm from the nipple is substantially decreased, with ill-defined nonmass enhancement the site of the previous mass, which measures up to 1.1 cm, centered on the postbiopsy marker.
The right axillary biopsy-proven malignant lymph node conglomerate at level one is mildly decreased in size, but still markedly abnormal, measuring up to 2.6 cm in axial plane. 
There is no additional lymphadenopathy in the axilla or internal mammary stations.
LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
