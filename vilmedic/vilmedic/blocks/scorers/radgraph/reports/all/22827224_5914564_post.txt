FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal prominent but stable right axillary lymph nodes.  
Previous ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy was negative 
for metastatic disease.
 
The breasts are composed of heterogeneously dense tissue with minimal 
background enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
The known triple negative carcinoma in the right breast, 1230 to one 
o'clock position, 5.5 cm from the nipple, has markedly decreased in 
size.  Only a 14 x 9 x 7 mm area of enhancement remains, adjacent to 
the post biopsy marker, best seen on slice locator S1.7.
 
Slightly superior to the known carcinoma is a 7-mm T2 hyperintense 
mass demonstrating gradual enhancement kinetics, best seen on slice 
locator S20.4.  Compared to prior exam, this mass is stable and 
probably represents a benign entity such as a fibroadenoma.  However, 
given its proximity to the index cancer, we recommend concomitant 
removal at that time of surgery under MRI guided bracket wire 
localization.
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
There are no areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to 
suggest invasive malignancy.
 
Again seen is a stable 1.5-cm T2 hyperintense enhancing mass in the 
left breast, 1230 to one o'clock position, 5.5 cm from the nipple, 
corresponding to biopsy proven fibroadenoma.  A post biopsy marker is 
identified within the mass.
