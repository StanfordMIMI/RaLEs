FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with moderate background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
The suspicious/significant enhancement associated with the sites of biopsy-proven malignancy has resolved. There is no suspicious enhancement in the breast.
The R1, R2 and R3 biopsy markers are seen.    The residual calcifications and the biopsy markers should be used to guide localization, see separate 5/17/2019 diagnostic mammogram report.  
There is no lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST:
At 3:00 posterior depth, 9 cm from the nipple, there is an enhancing mass that is centrally T2 hyperintense, consistent with an inflamed cyst. (series 24, image 1924).
There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
