mastectomy with autologous TRAM flap reconstruction.  The composition 
of the TRAM flap is predominantly fatty.  There are large bilateral 
blood vessels representing the pedicles feeding the autologous 
reconstructions in the central portion of the breast.  There is 
signal void noted at the chest wall bilaterally in the region of the 
pedicle which limits evaluation.  In the right breast, there is an 
irregular, enhancing, spiculated mass measuring approximately 1.7 x 
1.5 cm in size approximately 7 cm from the nipple, series 7 image 143 
R106.5, which likely corresponds to known breast cancer.
