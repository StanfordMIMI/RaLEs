FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of extreme fibroglandular tissue with marked background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: At 11 o'clock, anterior depth, 2 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with irregular margins which are difficult to distinguish from the surrounding tissue, and heterogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 3.2 cm AP x 2.0 cm RL x  3.8 cm SI. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on series 24, image 1962. Susceptibility artifact from barrel marker. 
R2/R3: At 4 o'clock, anterior depth, 1.0 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with irregular margins which difficult to distinguish from the surrounding tissue, and heterogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 1.0 cm AP x 1.8 cm RL x  1.4 cm SI. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on series 24, image 1979. Susceptibility artifact from marker.
Rax: There is a 1.1 x 1.1 cm right axillary lymph node on series 24, image 1909, with susceptibility artifact from biopsy marker corresponding to biopsy-proven metastasis.
There is enhancement of the right nipple. Medical follow-up is recommended.
LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
