FINDINGS:
No axillary, subpectoral, internal mammary, or supraclavicular 
lymphadenopathy. Unremarkable regional structures.
RIGHT:
No dominant mass or architectural distortion to suggest invasive 
malignancy within the right breast.
LEFT:
2.7 cm irregular mass-like area of presumed enhancement and 
architectural distortion, with evidence of wash-out on more delayed 
sequences, upper outer quadrant, 7 cm from the nipple, best seen on 
image 56 of series 404 of the axial post-gadolinium FSPGR sequence, 
and image 20 of series 7 of the sagittal delayed post-gadolinium 
FSPGR sequence.  Finding corresponds to location of the patient's 
biopsy-proven invasive ductal carcinoma.  No other dominant mass or 
architectural distortion to suggest invasive malignancy elsewhere in 
the left breast.
