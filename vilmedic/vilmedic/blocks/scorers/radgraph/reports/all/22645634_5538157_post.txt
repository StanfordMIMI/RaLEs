FINDINGS: 
 Fatty axillary lymph nodes appear unchanged compared to previous 
exam. Unremarkable regional structures. 
RIGHT: Compared to prior images, previous large mass now appears as 
segregated multiple small masses with clumped enhancement spanning a 
total area of 8.7 cm in the upper inner and upper outer breast, with 
a moderately enhancing retro areolar focus. There are scattered foci 
with bright enhancement throughout the breast which may represent 
residual disease. However, there is overall less enhancement on 
current study compared to previous study which implies some response 
to treatment.
