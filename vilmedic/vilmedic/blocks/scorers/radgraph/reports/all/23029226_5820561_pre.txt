FINDINGS: 
No abnormal axillary lymph nodes are definitely identified.
The breasts are composed of  dense fibroglandular breast tissue with
 moderate scattered background enhancement.
 
Right Breast:
 
R1: The known invasive carcinoma correlates to an heterogeneously 
enhancing irregular mass in the right upper outer quadrant at the 9 
to 10 o'clock position, 6.5 cm from the nipple base to the center.  
The mass demonstrates both rim and septal enhancement.  It measures 
approximately 2 x 1.5 x 1.7 cm.  The 1.7-cm measurement in the 
craniocaudal dimension may be exaggerated given the possibility of 
post biopsy changes.  An irregular signal void is seen within the 
mass, which may represent postbiopsy changes.  It does not have the 
typical appearance for a marker.
R2: Approximately 2.3 cm antero-inferior to the inferior margin of 
the carcinoma, 3.5 cm from the nipple, there is a 7-mm enhancing 
mass.  Again kinetics are not available.  This is best seen on slice 
locator 6.3, just below the level of the nipple. 
R3: There are several scattered < 5-mm enhancing foci.  There are 
also a few enhancing masses that are slightly larger than 5 mm, 
including one in the upper inner quadrant.  Again kinetics are not 
available.  While these findings could be nonspecific or technical, 
pathology cannot be definitely excluded.
R4: A few subcentimeter cysts are identified.
 
Left Breast:
 
There are several scattered nonspecific < 5-mm enhancing foci. There 
are also a few enhancing masses that are slightly larger than 5 mm, 
which may be nonspecific, technical, or pathologic. in addition, two 
cysts are seen in the upper outer quadrant, measuring 10 and 4 mm, 
which correlate to ultrasound. A few additional subcentimeter cysts 
are identified.
