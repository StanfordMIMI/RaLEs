FINDINGS:
The right breast is composed of extreme fibroglandular tissue with minimal background parenchymal enhancement.
RIGHT BREAST:
R1: At right axilla, 10:30 o'clock, 10-14 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with spiculated margins, and heterogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 4.0 cm AP x 2.0 cm RL x  2.5 cm SI. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on series 23,  image 1923. The mass contains susceptibility from markers placed on 8/5/2019 biopsy labeled R1 and R3. 
There is an adjacent enhancing level 1 axillary lymph node on series 23 image 1909 with loss of fat plane with the pectoralis musculature. There is no definite enhancement of the pectoralis muscle.
There is susceptibility artifact from a coil-shaped biopsy marker in the retroareolar breast. 
There is susceptibility artifact in the right breast at 12:00, 5 cm from the nipple, likely corresponding to a post biopsy marker adjacent to coarse calcifications on mammogram.There are tiny foci of enhancement surrounding the post biopsy marker over a 2 cm region. Core biopsy on 9/6/2011 in this location it shown a hyalinized fibroadenoma. Core biopsy on 9/6/2011 in this location had shown proliferative fibrocystic change.
LEFT BREAST: Postsurgical changes of left mastectomy and flap reconstruction. There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: Multiple T1 hypointense/T2 hyperintense liver lesions are nonspecific but stable from prior examinations and likely cysts or hemangiomata.
