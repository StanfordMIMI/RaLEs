FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with moderate background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST AND REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: 
R1: At 12:00 2 cm from the nipple, there is a biopsy marker. There is no significant residual R1 enhancement.
R2: At 10:00 8 cm from the nipple, there is a biopsy marker. There is no significant residual R2 enhancement. The R2 biopsy marker is approximately 6 cm posterior/lateral to the R1 biopsy marker. Note: Although the biopsy was described as the posterior aspect of R2, it may be better described as the superior aspect of R2.
Right axilla: The level 1 axillary lymph nodes are now morphologically normal. There is a biopsy marker in the biopsied lymph node ((series 23 image 1935).
There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST AND REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
