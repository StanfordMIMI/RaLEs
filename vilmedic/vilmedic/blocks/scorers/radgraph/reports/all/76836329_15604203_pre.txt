FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy. There is an intact retropectoral silicone implant.
R1: At  8 o'clock, anterior depth, 0.8 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with clustered ring enhancement circumscribed but lobulated margins, and heterogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 1.6 cm AP x 1.5 cm RL x  1.4 cm SI. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. It appears to correspond to a calcified mass in the mass that was biopsied at the outside facility on 7/29/2019 in San Mateo. The enhancement is best seen on series 26,  image 1967. It is located directly anterior and in continuity with R3, described below, along the anterior aspect of the R3 non-enhancement in the breast, at 7 o'clock, anterior depth. There is a dilated duct extending from R1 to the nipple (series 9 image 2433-35).
R2: At 7 o'clock, middle depth, 3.7 cm from the nipple, there is an oval mass with circumscribed margins, and homogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 2.1 cm AP x 2.1 cm RL x  2.5 cm SI. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on series 26,  image 1979 but it spans from 1976-1986.
R3: 7-9 o'clock, anterior to middle depth, 1-10 cm from the nipple, there is clumped non-mass enhancement in a segmental distribution, measuring 10 cm AP x 2.9 cm RL x   9  cm SI. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase  fast and delayed phase wash-out.The enhancement is best seen on series 26,  image 1973 but it spans from 1960-1987. It is suggestive of DCIS. There is a small focus of susceptibility, probably a biopsy marker, along the medial aspect of this nonmass enhancement (series 26 image 1973).
R4: At 1 o'clock, middle depth, 3 cm from the nipple, there is homogeneous non-mass enhancement in a focal distribution, measuring 0.4 cm AP x 0.5 cm RL x  0.7 cm SI. It is adjacent to the anteromedial aspect of the implant. It could be part of a small chain of enhancement extending posteromedially from R3 (series 26 image 1970-1972). Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase  fast and delayed phase persistent. The enhancement is best seen on series 26,  image 1970. It is also seen on series 2654 image 135.
There is right axillary lymphadenopathy. One right axillary lymph node measured 1.1 x 1.4 x 1 cm (series 26 image 1917). Another right axillary lymph measures 1 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm (series 26 image 1924); it has focally thickened cortex measuring up to 0.7 cm. There is a subcentimeter right axillary lymph node that measures 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.9 cm (series 26 image 1930).
There is a 3 mm right internal mammary lymph node (series 26 image 1924).
LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy. There is an intact retropectoral silicone implant.
There is a left axillary lymph node that measures 0.9 x 1.4 x 1.4 cm (series 26 image 1904).
OTHER FINDINGS: There are multiple hypointense gallstones in the gallbladder.
