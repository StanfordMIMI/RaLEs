FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of extreme fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: Extending from the subareolar/central breast caudally to 6 - 7:00 o'clock, extending from anterior to posterior depth, anteriorly involving the nipple areolar complex and posteriorly extending to 0.1 cm from the chest wall, there is a mass and associated non mass enhancement. Specifically, at anterior depth there is an irregular mass with spiculated margins measuring up to 2.8 cm, and contiguous with the mass extending caudally and inferiorly there is segmental heterogeneous non mass enhancement measuring up to 3.0 cm. Together, the findings spanning measuring 5.1 AP x 2.9 TV x 3.0 SI cm. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase  fast and delayed phase persistent. The enhancement is best seen on axial peak contrast series 25, image 1951 - 1972, and sagittal peak postcontrast series 2552 image 124.. There are associated findings of nipple areolar complex retraction and invasion.
There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: 
At 11 o'clock, posterior depth, 6 cm from the nipple, there is a 0.6 cm oval, circumscribed homogeneously enhancing, T2 hyperintense mass, consistent with a benign intramammary lymph node.
There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy. 
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
