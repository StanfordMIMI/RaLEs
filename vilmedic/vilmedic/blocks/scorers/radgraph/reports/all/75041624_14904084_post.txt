FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of extreme fibroglandular tissue with minimal background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST:
L1: At 11 o'clock, middle depth, 3.5 cm from the nipple, decrease in size of an irregular mass with irregular margins, and heterogeneous internal enhancement, now measuring 1.0 cm AP x 1.2 cm RL x  1.3 cm SI, previously measuring 2.1 cm AP x 2.4 cm RL x  2.8 cm SI. The enhancement is best seen on series 24,  image 1938. There is a biopsy marker clip located within the medial aspect of the mass. 
L2: There is a biopsy marker clip located at 9:00, posterior, 6 cm from the nipple at site of biopsy-proven DCIS without an associated MR finding. This is best seen on series 24, image 1972.
There is a biopsy marker clip located within a normal lymph node in the left axilla at 1:00, 12 cm from the nipple, from prior benign biopsy. Decrease in prominence of left axillary lymph nodes.
There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: Right chest wall Mediport in place. Diffuse T2 hyperintense marrow signal with associated enhancement favored to represent marrow related changes from chemotherapy.
