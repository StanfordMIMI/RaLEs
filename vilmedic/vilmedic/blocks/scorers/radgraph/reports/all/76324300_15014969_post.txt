FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with minimal background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts. There are intact bilateral subpectoral saline implants.
RIGHT BREAST AND REGIONAL LYMPH NODES:
R1: There is a biopsy marker at 12 o'clock, 5 cm  from the nipple. The 1.2 cm AP x 1.2 cm RL x 1.5 cm CC enhancing mass in this area has resolved.
R2: There is a biopsy marker at 1 o'clock, 3 cm from the nipple. Just posterior to this biopsy marker, there is a focus measuring 0.3 cm AP x 0.2 cm RL x  0.3 cm SI.  The enhancement is best seen on series 26,  image 2267. Previously there was a 2.1 cm AP x 2.6 cm RL x 3.1 cm SI enhancing mass in this area. 
R3: At 1 o'clock,  6 cm from the nipple, the 1.7 cm AP x 1.9 cm RL x 2 cm SI enhancing mass medial to R2 has resolved.
R4: At 1 o'clock, 10 cm from the nipple, the non-mass enhancement has near completely resolved. There is a trace 0.4 cm focus of non-mass enhancement left.
R5: At 2 o'clock, subareolar position, the non-mass enhancement has resolved. 
R6: At 8 o'clock,  subareolar position, there is clumped non-mass enhancement in a linear distribution, measuring 1.9 cm AP x 1.3 cm RL x  0.6 cm SI. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase  fast and delayed phase plateau. The enhancement is best seen on series 24,  image 1920.
There is no abnormal enhancement involving the pectoralis major, chest wall, or implant capsule.
There is no suspicious lymphadenopathy. There is susceptibility artifact from a Savi Scout (series 3 image 51) in the area of a previously enlarged lymph node; no residual lymph node is seen.
LEFT BREAST AND REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
