FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST:
R1 & R2: Multiple previously described enhancing masses within the right breast at 2-3 o'clock, spanning 1 to 8 cm from the nipple have decreased in size and extent. There is persistent medialization of the nipple with skin thickening and retraction. The area of nonmass enhancement spanning these prior masses now spans approximately 7.7 x 2.2 x 3.2 cm, previously 7.0 x 4.8 x 7.5 cm, extending contiguously from the nipple to the posterior medial breast (reconstructed axial series 2053, image 29; reconstructed sagittal series 2051, image 46). The area of nonmass enhancement is no longer seen to directly extend to the chest wall. Previously described masses along the pectoralis musculature and chest wall are no longer seen. At the site of previously described biopsy-proven malignant R1 mass at 2:00, 2 cm from the nipple, there is no longer a solid enhancing mass, replaced by an area of linear nonmass enhancement measuring 2.2 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm with heterogeneous and clumped internal 
enhancement. A focus of central susceptibility artifact corresponds to previously placed ribbon-shaped biopsy marker clip. The previously described R2 mass located at 1:30, 5 cm from the nipple has decreased in size, now measuring 1.3 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm, previously 1.3 cm, and remains contained within the posterior medial area of contiguous nonmass enhancement. This mass is irregular and spiculated with heterogeneous internal enhancement (series 20, image 1971). Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. This area appears to correlate to the calcifications in the inner right breast seen on mammogram same day, 7/5/2018.
R3: No MRI correlate to the previously described benign mass at 10:00, 3 cm from the nipple, on prior mammography and ultrasound. 
Right axilla: Focus of susceptibility artifact corresponding to previously biopsy-proven metastatic level 1 axillary lymph node (series 20, image 1903), with faint surrounding irregular enhancement in a spiculated pattern, measuring approximately 1.1 x 1.6 cm, previously 1.7 x 1.9 cm. There are no additional nonsuspicious right axillary lymph nodes.
LEFT BREAST:
L1 & L2: Multiple previously described enhancing masses within the central left breast at 2:00-3:00, spanning 2-8 cm from the nipple, have all decreased in size and extent. Corresponding to the previously described biopsy-proven malignant L1 mass at 2:00, 6 cm from the nipple, there is now only an area of focal nonmass enhancement with heterogeneous and clustered ring internal enhancement measuring approximately 1.8 x 2.7  x 1.4 cm, previously 5.5 x 4.1 x 3.8 cm. A focus of central susceptibility artifact corresponds to previously placed twirl shaped biopsy marker. At the site of previously described L2 mass at 3:00, 3 cm from the nipple, there is no corresponding mass, however this area remains within the decreased area of spanning nonmass enhancement. The area of nonmass enhancement spanning these prior masses now spans approximately 3.0 x 2.7 x 2.6 cm, previously 5.5 x 4.1 x 3.8 cm, and crossed into the upper inner quadrant (reconstructed axial series 2053, image 32). This entire 
area appears to correlate to the calcifications in the inner left breast and outer left breast seen on mammogram same day, 7/5/2019.
Left axilla: No suspicious left axillary lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: Partially imaged right chest port catheter in the superior vena cava.
