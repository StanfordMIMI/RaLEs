FINDINGS:  The breast tissue is heterogeneously dense.  
 
AXIAL T1:  There are no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes.  There is a 
left Mediport within the left chest.  The regional structures are 
grossly unremarkable. 
 
RIGHT BREAST:  The prior MRI dated 05/06/2009 demonstrated a 2 x 2 cm 
spiculated mass at the 12 o'clock position approximately 2.5 cm from 
the nipple with a post biopsy marker at slice locator R76.3 to 89.9.  
This mass demonstrated rapid wash-in and wash-out.  The current MRI 
exam demonstrates minimal residual rim enhancement around the tissue 
marker, however, there is no associated suspicious kinetic curve.  
The kinetic curves in the area of residual rim enhancement 
demonstrates a gradual wash-in.  
Additionally, in the right breast retroareolar region, there is a 
stable1 cm cyst with at least one discernible internal septation 
located at series 8, image 38, slice locator R91.  There are 
scattered, preexisting nonspecific foci of enhancement just medial to 
the cancer site at approximately 5-5:30 o'clock in position and 
compared to prior MRI in 05/2009, these foci of enhancement are 
smaller.
