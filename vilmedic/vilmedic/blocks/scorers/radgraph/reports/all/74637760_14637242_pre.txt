FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with marked background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts..
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: At 7 o'clock, middle depth, 5.0 cm from the nipple, there is an oval mass with circumscribed margins, and homogeneous internal enhancement, that is T2 hyperintense, measuring 0.6 cm AP by 0.5 cm RL by 0.5 cm SI cm. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase plateau. The enhancement is best seen on series 20, image 1985.   
There are scattered cysts. There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST:
L1: Occupying all four quadrants and extending from anterior to middle depth, there are multiple confluent irregular masses with spiculated margins, and heterogeneous internal enhancement, in total measuring 4.8 cm AP by 5.3 cm RL by 8.0 cm SI. This includes the previously-demonstrated ultrasound biopsy-proven malignancy at 12:00 3 cm from the nipple. There is a (ribbon) marker clip in this 12:00 component.  Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on series 2050 image 2, and series 2051 image 43.
There are associated features of nipple areolar complex invasion (series 20 image 1965), nipple inversion or retraction, and diffuse skin thickening.
There are multiple abnormal LEFT level 1 through 3 axillary lymph nodes and an abnormal interpectoral lymph node (series 20 image 1879). 
There are at least two abnormal internal mammary lymph nodes, which appear to be in the second and fourth interspaces. The larger measures up to 1.0 cm (series 20 image 1977), and the smaller measures up to 0.7 cm (series 20 image 1931).
There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
