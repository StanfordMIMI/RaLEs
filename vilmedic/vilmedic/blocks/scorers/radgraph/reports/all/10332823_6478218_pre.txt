FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes.
 
The breasts are composed of heterogeneously dense tissue with minimal 
scattered foci of background enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
R1,  There is a 10 x 14 mm avidly enhancing irregular mass, 3.6 cm 
from the base of the nipple, in the 6:00 position, best seen on 
series 2550 image 61, with a central signal void corresponding to the 
biopsy marker present on the April 4, 2012 mammogram in the known 
cancer.  On dynamic imaging, this enhances rapidly at first, followed 
by persistent late enhancement.  Surrounding this mass, is an 
ill-defined region of less intense, gradual enhancement, that 
includes some ductal enhancement extending toward the nipple, 
spanning a total region of 3.5 cm best seen on series 2551 image 19.   
DCIS cannot be excluded, but this could also be due to inflammation 
from recent biopsies.  
 
Elsewhere in the right breast there are a few tiny foci of background 
enhancement, but no abnormal areas to suggest multicentric tumor.
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
There are no areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to 
suggest invasive malignancy.
