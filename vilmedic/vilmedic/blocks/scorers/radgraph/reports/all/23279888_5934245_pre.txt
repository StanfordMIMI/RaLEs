FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal several abnormal right axillary lymph nodes. The 
largest level 1 lymph node measures 1.8 x 1.3 cm  (2.8 x 1.4 cm on 
10/13/10). The second largest measures 1.2 x 1.1 cm, also level 1 
(previously 1.3 x 1.1 cm).
 
There is a left infraclavicular portacath.
 
The breasts are composed of dense tissue with minimal     background 
enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
There is a large irregular known malignancy which seems centered in 
the upper slightly outer quadrant, but extends into the lower outer 
and upper inner quadrant as well. Some linear enhancement can be seen 
centrally extending to the nipple base. The mass is difficult to 
measure given its irregular shape and several satellite lesions, but 
is roughly 6.5 x 4.3 cm compared to 8 cm x 5.7 cm previously. The 
mass continues to demonstrate rapid rise and washout enhancement 
kinetics. The abnormal right axillary lymph nodes demonstrate 
restricted diffusion on DWI images.
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
There is minimal to mild gradual enhancement in a 1.3 x 0.8 cm 
non-mass like distribution at the 12 o'clock position, 7 cm from the 
nipple, which is more well appreciated on the sagittal reformatted 
images and is fairly subtle (SL 76.39 of series 1102). 
 
There is no dominant mass or abnormal non-mass like enhancement 
otherwise. A tiny sub centimeter simple cyst is seen on series 2 
image 26 in the left posterior breast.
