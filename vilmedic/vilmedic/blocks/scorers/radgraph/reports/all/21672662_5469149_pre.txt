FINDINGS:  Axial T1 images demonstrate fatty breast parenchyma.  No 
evidence of skin or chest wall invasion.  Asymmetrically enlarged 
lymph nodes in the left axillary region. 
 
LEFT BREAST:  There is a mass in the upper outer left breast which 
demonstrates rim enhancement and internal septations, measuring 2.7 x 
2.2 cm at 1:30 o'clock position approximately 10.4 cm from the 
nipple.  There is no evidence of perilesional enhancement to suggest 
extension of disease.  There is no abnormal enhancement elsewhere in 
the left breast.  According to the 06/19/2009 review of outside 
films, the report states that the patient had additional mammographic 
findings in the lower left breast at approximately 7-8 o'clock, 
however, there is no MR correlate for this mammographic finding and 
therefore management should be based on the mammogram.  
 
RIGHT BREAST:  There is a biopsy clip in the right breast 
approximately 11 cm from the nipple in the lower inner quadrant at 
the site of presumed fibroadenoma that was previously biopsied.
