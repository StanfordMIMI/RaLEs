FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal at least 3 large nodal masses in the left axilla.  
These are slightly smaller compared with the previous examination.  
The nodal mass that previously measured 19 x 23 mm now measures 12 x 
20 mm.  The nodal mass that previously measured 22 x 24 mm now 
measures 13 x 14 mm.  The nodal mass that previously measured 24 x 27 
mm now measures 23 x 22 mm..
 
The breasts are composed of predominantly fatty tissue with minimal     
background enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
There are no areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to 
suggest invasive malignancy.
 
There are postbiopsy changes in the right upper breast around the 12 
o'clock position, with susceptibility artifact related to two 
postbiopsy markers which are in close proximity.  The previously seen 
enhancing mass is not visualized on this examination.
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
Much of the left upper outer quadrant is again involved by 
malignancy, multifocal in origin.  There is significant perilesional 
edema. The entire area now measures 7.5 x 5 x 4.5 cm, which is 
overall slightly decreased in size, as it previously measured 9 x 5 x 
5.4 cm. there is also decrease in size of the individual masses 
within this.  There is rapid enhancement on postcontrast images with 
washout, but the wash in and washout is slightly less rapid compared 
with previous examination, suggesting a modest response to 
chemotherapy with substantial residual disease.
