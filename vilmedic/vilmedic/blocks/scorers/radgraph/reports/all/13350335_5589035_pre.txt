FINDINGS: A diagnostic quality of this scan is limited, given the 
inability to obtain uniform excitation, motion, as well as patient's 
body habitus. The breast is diffusely fatty in composition. 
At the 9 o'clock position in the right breast, approximately 11 cm 
from the nipple, there is a 3.7 x 3.0 cm mass. This is a new finding 
compared with December 2009.  The mass contains several spiculations 
extending anteriorly and medially from this lesion up to 
approximately 1 cm.  A small amount of peripheral surrounding edema, 
as well as perilesional enhancement is identified, extending 
approximately 5 mm beyond the boundaries of the main mass. No obvious 
additional foci of abnormal enhancement are seen remote from the 
primary lesion. 
At least two abnormal right axillary lymph nodes identified, the 
largest measuring up to 22 mm in short axis diameter. However, given 
the limitations of today's scan, the superior axilla has not been 
included on the images.
