FINDINGS:  Axial T1-weighted images demonstrate small right axillary 
lymph nodes which appear to have fatty hila.
 
Right breast:  A large, mass-like area of enhancement is seen 
extending over much of the right upper outer quadrant and right upper 
inner quadrant.  Although the mass is irregularly shaped, it extends 
for approximately 8 cm in transverse dimension, 6 cm in AP dimension, 
and 4.3 cm in craniocaudal dimension.  Multiple enhancement curves 
over the area of the mass demonstrate gradual enhancement.  
T2-weighted images demonstrate a large amount of subcutaneous edema 
within the anterior aspect of the right breast raising the suspicion 
of inflammatory breast cancer.  The mass does not appear to involve 
the skin surface; however, in one area, the mass extends to within 
1-2 cm of the nipple, and involvement of the deep aspect of the 
nipple is difficult to exclude.  Also, the anterior portions of both 
breasts were excluded on the 3D SSMT images, but can be seen on the 
T2 and spiral images. 
 
Left breast:  A few, nonspecific foci of enhancement are seen within 
the left breast which have a benign appearance, as well as benign 
kinetic curves.
