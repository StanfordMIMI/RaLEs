FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with moderate background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: There are scattered cysts. 
R1: In the upper outer and upper inner quadrants, extending from 10:00 to 2:00, and from middle to posterior depth, anteriorly 6 cm from the nipple and posteriorly 0.2 cm from the pectoralis major muscle, there are multiple adjacent irregular masses with irregular and/or spiculated margins and heterogeneous enhancement.  Worst curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase washout. In total, the masses and span 5.5 cm AP by 8.5 cm RL by 4.0 cm SI.  This appears to be one process, within which the largest/most discrete areas are:
R1a: 10:00 posterior depth, 10 cm from the nipple, measuring up to 2.8 cm (series 24, image 1989).
R1b:  12:00 middle depth, 6 cm from the nipple, measuring up to 1.6 cm (series 24, image 1978).
R1c:  2:00 posterior depth, 10 cm from the nipple, measuring up to on image 1989).
There are at least 2 abnormal-appearing level 1 axillary lymph nodes, and possibly an abnormal level 2 lymph node (see series 2 image 16).
There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: There are scattered cysts.
There are multiple similar-appearing oval masses with circumscribed margins and homogeneous or heterogeneous internal enhancement, some T2 hyperintense, which given multiplicity and morphology are consistent with benign fibroadenomata. Worst curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase plateau. These are located at: 
1:00 middle depth 7 cm from the nipple, measuring up to 1.4 cm) series 24, image 1976).
9-10 o'clock posterior depth 9 cm from the nipple, measuring up to 0.9 cm (series 24, image 1965).
4:00 posterior depth 8.5 cm from the nipple, measuring up to 0.6 cm (series 24, image 1955).
 There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: There is cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
