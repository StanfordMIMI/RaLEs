FINDINGS: 
Geographic area of dark T1 signal in bilateral humeral heads, 
suggestive of a marrow infiltrative process which may be seen in the 
setting of chemotherapy affect, however osseous metastatic 
involvement is not excluded and correlation with bone scan is 
recommended.  Otherwise, unremarkable regional structures.  No 
lymphadenopathy.  
Post-surgical changes of skin-sparing and nipple-sparing bilateral 
mastectomy with TRAM flap reconstruction, including slight 
enhancement and susceptibility artifact near the chest wall 
bilaterally in the region of the vascular pedicles.
LEFT BREAST:
Non-enhancing focal asymmetry within the cranial portion of the 
reconstructed breast (SL L104.1), which may represent fat necrosis, 
however there has been no known biopsy to confirm this.  No abnormal 
enhancement suspicious for invasive malignancy elsewhere in the left 
breast.
RIGHT BREAST:
Near complete resolution of previously seen 1.7 x 1.5 cm spiculated 
enhancing mass at 10:30 o'clock 7 cm from the nipple, which now is 
seen as a 5mm round focus without definite enhancement (SL R5.9).  No 
abnormal enhancement suspicious for invasive malignancy elsewhere in 
the right breast.
