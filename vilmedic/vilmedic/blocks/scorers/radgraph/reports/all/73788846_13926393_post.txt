FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with minimal background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: Redemonstrated is the L1 biopsy-proven mass at 5:00, 6-7 cm from the nipple containing susceptibility artifact internally at site of biopsy marking clip. This is best appreciated on series 23 image 1923 and series 2352, image 40 and has significantly decreased in size when compared to MRI of 1/2/2019. This currently measures 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.9 cm (anterior-posterior x mediolateral x craniocaudal) versus on prior study where this mass measured up to 3.1 cm. Nonmass enhancement is noted to extend anteriorly from this mass over approximately 2.2 cm, seen on series 23 image 1920 and adjacent images. 
Susceptibility artifact is noted within the left axilla, series 23 image 1980 adjacent to biopsy-proven metastatic lymph node. Overall, the lymph nodes look better when compared to prior MRI and have normalized in appearance.
Nonspecific 0.4 cm left internal mammary lymph node is identified, series 23 image 1954.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
