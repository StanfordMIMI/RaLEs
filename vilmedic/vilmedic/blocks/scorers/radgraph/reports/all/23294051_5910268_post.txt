FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes. Several 
benign-appearing bilateral axillary lymph nodes are again identified.
 
The breasts are composed of predominantly fatty tissue with minimal 
background enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
There has been no significant interval change in size of an 11 x 7 mm 
spiculated mass in the deep central right breast approximately 8 cm 
from the nipple demonstrating gradual enhancement kinetics, 
compatible with the patient's known infiltrating ductal carcinoma (SL 
S24 series 8, image 3,223), unchanged from 1/6/2011 when it also 
measured 11 mm in size.  This mass continues to extend towards the 
pectoralis muscle, with no obvious pectoralis muscle enhancement.  
There is a stable central focus of susceptibility within this lesion 
likely reflect a post biopsy metal marker.  No new masses or 
additional suspicious areas of enhancement are identified. 
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
There are no areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to 
suggest invasive malignancy.
