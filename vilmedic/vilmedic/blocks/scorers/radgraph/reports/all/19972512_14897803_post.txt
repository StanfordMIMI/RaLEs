FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of scattered fibroglandular tissue with minimal background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: At 10 o'clock, posterior depth, 7 cm from the nipple, there are 2 biopsy markers. The previously seen mass has near completely resolved. There is a 0.4 cm AP x 0.4 RL x 0.5 cm SI focus of faint enhancement (series 24 image 1957) at the location of the medial aspect of the previously seen mass; it is difficult to characterize this as residual enhancement or background enhancement.
R2: At 9:30, middle depth, 5 cm from the nipple, there is an oval mass with irregular margins, and faint homogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 0.7 cm AP x 0.7 cm RL x  0.7 cm SI (previously measured 1.4 x 0.7 x 1.3 cm on 6/14/2019). The enhancement is best seen on series 24,  image 1972.
R3: At 9:30, middle depth, 5 cm from the nipple, there is a focus measuring 0.3 cm AP x 0.2 cm RL x  0.5 cm SI (previously it measured 0.5 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm on 6/14/2019). The enhancement is best seen on series 24,  image 1979.
 There is no suspicious lymphadenopathy. There is a biopsy-proven metastatic lymph node containing a  marker (series 3 image 60).
LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
