FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogenous with moderate background parenchymal enhancement that is asymmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: At 2 o'clock, posterior depth, 8.6 cm from the nipple, there is an oval mass with circumscribed margins, and homogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 1.1 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The mass is best seen on axial peak contrast DISCO series image 1955, and sagittal peak series image 54.
There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST:
L1: At 3 o'clock, anterior depth, 3 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with spiculated margins, and heterogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 1.6 x 1.6 x 2.4 cm. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The mass is best seen on axial peak contrast DISCO series image 1967, and sagittal peak series image 134. Susceptibility artifact from the cork titanium marker is seen just outside the mid lateral margin of the mass. The mass generally corresponds to the area of calcifications seen by mammography.
L2: At 3 o'clock, middle depth, 4.7 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with irregular margins, and heterogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase plateau. The mass is best seen on axial peak contrast DISCO series image 1965, and sagittal peak series image 135. This finding is 1.5 cm posterior to L1 and is suspicious for a satellite lesion. There is no definite mammographic correlate.
There is at least one abnormal left level 1 mid axillary lymph node with eccentric cortical thickening best appreciated on  axial peak contrast DISCO series image 1914
There is no other suspicious enhancement.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
