FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST:
R1: In the upper outer and upper inner quadrants, extending from 10:00 to 2:00, and from middle to posterior depth, anteriorly 6 cm from the nipple and posteriorly 0.4 cm from the pectoralis major muscle, there are multiple adjacent irregular masses with irregular and/or spiculated margins and heterogeneous enhancement.  The total area of breast covered by the abnormal process measures 7 x 5 x 3 cm (transverse, AP, CC). Worst curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase washout. The overall amount of abnormal enhancement is decreased from the comparison study, although there is clear residual enhancing tumor. Using the same labeling convention as the comparison MRI, further details are as follows:
R1a: 10:00 posterior depth, 10 cm from the nipple, measuring up to 1.8 cm, previously measuring up to 2.8 cm in similar plane (series 23, image 1929).  There is a twirl maker in the abnormal enhancement.
R1b:  12:00 middle depth, 6 cm from the nipple, measuring up to 0.8 cm, previously measuring up to 1.6 cm in similar plane (series 23, image 1933). 
R1c:  2:00 posterior depth, 10 cm from the nipple, measuring up to 1.6 cm, previously measuring up to 2.8 cm in similar plane (series 23, image 1929).  There is an x-shaped marker in the abnormal enhancement.
There is slightly decreased cortical thickening in the 2 previously detailed abnormal level 1 lymph nodes. A postbiopsy marker is noted in the adjacent to the more superficial node. Previously noted possibly abnormal level 2 lymph node is stable (series 2, image 43).  
There are scattered cysts. There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy. 
LEFT BREAST:  There are scattered cysts. Redemonstrated multiple similar-appearing oval masses with circumscribed margins and homogeneous or heterogeneous internal enhancement, some T2 hyperintense, which given multiplicity and morphology are consistent with benign fibroadenomata, as previously detailed. The largest measures up to 1.4 cm at 1:00 7 cm from the nipple (series 23, image 1938). There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy. 
OTHER FINDINGS: A left-sided chest port is present.
