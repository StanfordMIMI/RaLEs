FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal mildly prominent right axillary lymph nodes.  The 
largest two measure 13.4 x 7.6 millimeters (S81.1) and 9.5 x 6.5 mm 
(S66.1).  Please refer to prior right axillary ultrasound.
 
The breasts are composed of heterogeneously dense tissue with marked 
background enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
There is a 17.1 x 19.5 x 18 mm T2 hyperintense round heterogeneously 
enhancing mass with rapid wash in and washout kinetics in the right 
breast, one o'clock position, 5 cm from the nipple, best seen on 
R75.8 (R1).  Susceptibility artifact within the mass consistent with 
a postbiopsy marker is present.
 
There are several scattered subcentimeter cysts or fibroadenomas in 
both breasts.
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
There is a 12.1 x 10.3 x 16.9 mm T2 hyperintense round lobulated 
heterogeneously enhancing mass with rapid wash in and washout 
kinetics in the left breast, 1230 to one o'clock position, 5.5 cm 
from the nipple, best seen on L86.2 (L1).
 
There are several scattered subcentimeter cysts or fibroadenomas in 
both breasts.
