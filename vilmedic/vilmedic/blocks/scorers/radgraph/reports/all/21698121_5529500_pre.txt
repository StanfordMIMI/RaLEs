FINDINGS:  Limited T1-weighted images through the thorax demonstrate 
an enlarged right axillary lymph node measuring 1.3 x 2.5 cm (series 
2, image 33, slice locator S10).  This approximates the location of 
lymph node biopsy done 08/14/2009 at which time it was negative for 
malignancy.  The heart is mildly dilated.  Regional structures are 
otherwise grossly unremarkable.  
 
Breast tissue is largely fatty with mild to moderate background 
enhancement.  The examination of the breasts is moderate to severely 
limited secondary to considerable motion artifact.  The lobulated 
enhancing mass is identified within the upper outer porton of the 
right breast, 7.2 cm from the nipple.  This lesion measures 1.1 x 1 x 
1.1 cm and is best seen on series 8, image 32, slice locator R81.3.  
This lesion demonstrates rapid wash-in and wash-out of contrast.   
 
Scattered foci of gradual enhancement within the left breast do not 
demonstrate specific worrisome features for malignancy.
