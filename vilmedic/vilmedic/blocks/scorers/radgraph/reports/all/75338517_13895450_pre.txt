FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with moderate background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST:
L1 and L2: At 12-3:00, anterior-middle depth, 2-7 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with irregular margins and three adjacent spiculated masses in contact with the primary mass each measuring up to 1 cm, showing heterogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 4.7 x 3.8 x 2.6 cm in totality and encompasses the L1 and L2 masses seen on ultrasound 11/12/2018. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on axial peak contrast series 23, image 1944. There is susceptibility from the scout reflector in the superior aspect of the mass We note that on the prior study L1 and L2 were a conglomerate of masses seen on ultrasound biopsy of 11/15/2018
L3: There is susceptibility artifact from the scout reflector at the 6:00 position, 1 cm from the nipple placed during a concordant benign ultrasound-guided core biopsy (series 23, image 1972). Note that this lesion was previously designated as L3.
L4: At 7-8 o'clock, posterior depth, 7 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with spiculated margins, and heterogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on axial peak contrast series 23,  image 1940.
There are at least three abnormal left axillary level 1 lymph nodes, one of which contains a biopsy marker, with pathology demonstrating metastatic carcinoma on 11/15/2018, at 12:30 o'clock 12 cm from the nipple, best seen on series 23 image 1900.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
