FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with moderate background parenchymal enhancement that is asymmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST AND REGIONAL LYMPH NODES:
R1: At 11:00, 1-3 cm from the nipple, an irregular heterogeneously enhancing mass with irregular margins, and some associated non-mass enhancement, is again noted, currently measuring 2.6 (AP) x 1.3 (RL) x 1.9 cm (SI), which is decreased in size compared to prior measurement of 3.2 x 2.0 x 3.8 cm. In the anterior superior aspect of the mass, there is a biopsy marker (spring-shaped per outside mammogram), for biopsy proven IDC/DCIS. There is an oval homogeneously enhancing T2-hyperintense satellite mass with circumscribed margins adjacent to the posterolateral aspect of R1, measuring 0.7 (AP) x 0.6 (RL) x 0.6 (SI) cm, with worst-curve kinetics demonstrating initial phase fast and delayed phase washout. This satellite mass appears to directly abut the chest wall (series 23, image 1927 and series 2352, image 111), with involvement of the right pectoralis muscle not excluded.  
R2: At 4:00, 1-2 cm from the nipple, an irregular mass with irregular margins is again noted, with some associated satellite masses, collectively measuring approximately 1.3 (AP) x 1.3 (RL) x 1.3 (SI) cm, previously measuring 1.0 x 1.8 x 1.4 cm. In the inferomedial aspect of the mass, a biopsy marker (barrel shape per outside mammogram) is seen, for biopsy proven IDC/DCIS.
In the right axilla, there is a 1.0 x 0.7 cm lymph node (series 2, image 39), which previously measured 1.3 x 0.9 cm. There is a biopsy marker in the anterior aspect of the lymph node, for biopsy-proven metastasis.
LEFT BREAST AND REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: 
L1: At 1 o'clock, posterior depth, 3 cm from the nipple, there is a round mass with circumscribed margins, and homogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 0.7 cm AP x 0.7 cm RL x  0.7 cm SI. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on series 23,  image 1940, and series 2352, image 29.
There is no suspicious lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: A left chest Mediport is present.
