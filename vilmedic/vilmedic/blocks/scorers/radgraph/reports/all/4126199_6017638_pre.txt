FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal normal appearing axillary lymph nodes.
 
The breasts are composed of heterogeneously dense tissue with 
moderate background enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
Patient is status post right mastectomy with an intact silicone 
implant reconstruction. There are no areas of suspicious mass or 
non-mass enhancement to suggest invasive malignancy.
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
There is a 16 x 15 x 14 mm irregular mass in the left breast, 2 clock 
position, 6.5 cm from nipple, best seen on slice locator S46.6 (L1). 
It demonstrates heterogeneous rim enhancement with rapid wash in 
kinetics.
 
Approximately 16 mm posterior and slightly lateral from the L1 
towards the axillary tail, about 9.5 cm from nipple, is a 10 x 10 x 
17 mm irregular mass, best seen on slice locator S52 (L2). This mass 
also demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement with rapid wash in 
kinetics.
 
Immediately adjacent to both masses are several subcentimeter 
enhancing masses, concerning for satellite lesions.
 
In the retroareolar slightly outer region, starting at 2.1 cm from 
the nipple, there is a 4.3 x 1.8 cm area of clumped and linear 
non-masslike enhancement, concerning for DCIS, best seen on slice 
locator is 16.6 (L3).
 
In total, the abnormalities described above span a maximal dimension 
of 10 cm.
 
The subpectoral silicone implant is intact.
