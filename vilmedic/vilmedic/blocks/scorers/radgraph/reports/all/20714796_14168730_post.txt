FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts. Motion artifact limits evaluation of the axillary regions. 
RIGHT BREAST:
R1:
At 9:00 extending from anterior to posterior depth, there is interval decreased confluence of the nonmass enhancement in a segmental distribution measuring 3.3 cm AP by 1.2 cm RL by 2.5 cm SI. Compared to the prior study, the MRI extent has slightly decreased in overall size (previously 4.0 x 1.5 x 2.6 cm). The findings are best seen on series 23 images 1974 to 1980. A round-shaped marker clip is again centered in the enhancement.
R2:
At 4:00 anterior depth, 3 cm from the nipple, there is no abnormal enhancement compared to the prior study. The buckle marker clip is again noted.
There are multiple mildly prominent level 1 axillary lymph nodes one of which contains the marker clip, grossly appear to be stable, although motion artifact limits evaluation.
There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
