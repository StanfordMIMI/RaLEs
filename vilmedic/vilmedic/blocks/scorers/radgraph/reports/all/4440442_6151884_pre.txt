FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal multiple grossly enlarged left axillary lymph nodes 
with obliterated fatty hila measuring up to 2.8 cm short axis.  This 
includes at least one level 3 / Rotter's node deep to the pectoralis 
minor muscle measuring 11 mm.
 
The breasts are composed of scattered fibroglandular tissue with 
minimal scattered foci of background enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
There are no areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to 
suggest invasive malignancy.
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
L1: There is a 2.1 x 1.8 cm well circumscribed mass with 
low/intermediate T2 signal intensity, a few low signal T2 septations, 
some surrounding perilesional edema, and avid rim enhancement best 
seen on series 8 at location S16 .9 in the upper outer quadrant 
approximately 9 cm from the nipple corresponding to the known tumor.  
This has restricted diffusion.  It has extremely rapid wash-in of 
contrast followed by very early wash-out of contrast material.
 
Elsewhere in the left breast there is no suspicion abnormal 
enhancement to suggest other evidence of disease
