FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of scattered fibroglandular tissue with minimal background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1:At 1 o'clock, posterior depth, 10 cm from the nipple, there is an oval mass with irregular margins, and heterogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 1.8 cm AP x 1.7 cm RL x  1.7 cm SI. Posteriorly, the mass is 3 cm from the pectoralis major muscle. The enhancement is best seen on series 24,  image 1952. There is a (coil-shaped) marker in the mass. The findings are best seen on series 24 image 1952.
R2: At retroareolar/central, anterior depth, 0.2 cm from the nipple, there is an oval mass with irregular margins, and heterogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 1.2 cm AP x 1.5 cm RL x  1.7 cm SI. The enhancement is best seen on series 24,  image 1959. There is a (paddle-shaped) marker in the mass. The findings are best seen on series 24 image 1959.
R3:: At retroareolar/central extending into all 4 quadrants, there are multiple similar-appearing oval masses with irregular margins and heterogeneous internal enhancement. Anteriorly, the masses are 0.7 cm from the nipple. Posteriorly, the masses are 6 cm from the pectoralis major muscle. In total, they span 6.5 cm AP by 4.8 cm RL by 5.7 cm SI. Medially, the R3 masses abut the R2 mass. The findings are best seen on series 2450 image 21. These findings include the previously-described (outside film interpretation) R3 and R4 findings.
There are multiple abnormal level 1 lymph nodes. The largest measures up to 2.2 cm (series 2453 image 22).
LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: There are superior mediastinal lymph nodes, which are small, but more numerous than are typically seen.
