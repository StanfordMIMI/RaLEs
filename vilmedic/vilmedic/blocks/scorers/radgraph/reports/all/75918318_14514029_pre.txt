FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: At 9 o'clock, posterior depth, 5 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with irregular margins, and rim enhancement, measuring 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm (AP x TV x SI). Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on axial peak contrast series 23, image 1938.  There is susceptibility within the center of the mass from the biopsy marker. 
There are at least 2 prominent level 1 right axillary lymph nodes, the largest of which has susceptibility from a biopsy marker in the lateral aspect of the node and measures 1.4 x 1.1 cm in the axial plane (T1-weighted series 2, image 59). The second lymph node measures 0.7 cm with an effaced hilum and is located just superior and medial to the biopsied lymph node (series 2, image 51).
There is no other suspicious enhancement.
LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: There are scattered and nonspecific T2-weighted hyperintense masses throughout the liver. The largest mass is in the posterior right hepatic lobe and is seen on the sagittal localizer sequence measuring up to 3.5 cm.
