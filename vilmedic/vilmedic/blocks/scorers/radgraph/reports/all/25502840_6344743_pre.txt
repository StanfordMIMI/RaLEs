FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal no axillary lymphadenopathy on MR.
 
Within the sternum, there is a 9-mm intrinsically T1 bright enhancing 
lesion that demonstrates contrast enhancement (series 8 image 90 
slice L 6.2) but is not included within the field of view of the T2 
sequence.
 
The breasts are composed of dense tissue with marked diffuse foci of 
background enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
Patient motion, and moderate/severe background enhancement limits 
evaluation, particularly in the upper outer aspect of the breast. 
Inhomogeneity artifact is present consistent with a biopsy marker in 
the right breast at the 6 o'clock position 4.5 cm from the nipple 
(series 8 image 42 slice R75.4). Small amount of bright T2 signal 
around the marker may represent seroma. There is an ill-defined mass 
lesion around this marker that demonstrate suspicious rapid contrast 
enhancement, measuring approximately 8 mm. The extent of local 
disease is difficult to evaluate due to background breast tissue 
enhancement. No additional discrete suspicious foci are demonstrated 
on this evaluation.
 
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
Patient motion, and moderate/severe background enhancement limits 
evaluation, particularly in the upper outer aspect of the breast. No 
discrete suspicious foci are demonstrated on this evaluation.
