FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal normal appearing axillary lymph nodes. Previously noted 
enlarged right axillary lymph node has decreased in size to 5 mm 
short axis. There is also a normal appearing 4 mm short axis right 
infraclavicular lymph node, which has decreased in size compared to 
prior.
 
A left chest wall Mediport is identified. There is interval red 
marrow expansion to the bilateral humeral heads.
 
The breasts are composed of heterogeneously dense tissue with mild 
background enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
The biopsy proven right breast cancer at the 130 position, 5 cm from 
the nipple, has markedly decreased in size. An 8-mm irregular mass 
remains adjacent to the postbiopsy marker with a few surrounding 
enhancing foci, best seen at slice locator R53.5. The mass 
demonstrates gradual wash in enhancement kinetics. Elsewhere, there 
are scattered nonspecific enhancing foci.
 
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
There are no areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to 
suggest invasive malignancy. There are scattered nonspecific 
enhancing foci.
