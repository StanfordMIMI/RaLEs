FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of scattered fibroglandular tissue with minimal background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: At retroareolar/central, middle depth, there is an irregular mass with spiculated margins, and homogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 1.8 x 1.5 cm. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on axial peak contrast series 25,  image 1970 and corresponds to sagittal hires series 1553, Image 153. This mass corresponds to the known biopsy-proven triple negative invasive ductal carcinoma with a bar-shaped biopsy marker clip located inferior to the mass. 
LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
