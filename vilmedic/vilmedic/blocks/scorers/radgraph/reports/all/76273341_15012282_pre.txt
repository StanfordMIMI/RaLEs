FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of extreme fibroglandular tissue with moderate background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: At 9:00-10:00, 5 cm from the nipple, there is a 5.6 x 6.5 x 4.3 cm irregularly shaped spiculated mass with postbiopsy change noted internally and a postbiopsy marker at the anterior aspect, reflecting the recent biopsy that showed invasive ductal carcinoma. This measurement includes the spiculations/obscured margins/non mass enhancement surrounding the mass. Worst curve kinetics are initial phase fast, delayed phase washout. No skin, pectoralis, or nipple involvement.
There is a lymph node with cortical thickening in the right axillary level 1, with a postbiopsy marker, reflecting recent benign biopsy. No other abnormal lymph nodes.
LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
