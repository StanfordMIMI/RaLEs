FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with minimal background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts. There is susceptibility artifact in the upper left breast and chest wall from an injection port.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: At 9:00 posterior depth 5 cm from the nipple there is no residual enhancement except for a tiny amount of enhancement inferior and slightly lateral to the susceptibility artifact from fiducial marker and postbiopsy marker. This is best seen on series 23 image 1962.
R ax: The large abnormal biopsy-proven metastatic axillary lymph node now containing a fiducial marker and postbiopsy marker is no longer seen as an enhancing mass. Now there are several small lymph nodes in the right axilla, without suspicious features.
LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: There are scattered and nonspecific T2-weighted hyperintense masses throughout the liver. The largest mass in the posterior right hepatic lobe  measuring up to 3.5 cm on the prior MRI cannot be evaluated today as is not well seen in the scanning field-of-view.
