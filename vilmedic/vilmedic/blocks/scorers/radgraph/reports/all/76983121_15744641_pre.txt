FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of scattered fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: There are scattered cysts. There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: 
L1/2:   At 2 o'clock at anterior to middle depth, anteriorly 5 cm from the nipple, the previously described L1 and L2 masses are shown to be a single lesion on MRI, and also on mammogram (see separate report). The MRI lesion is confluent masses and non mass enhancement, in total spanning approximately 4.0 cm AP by 3.0 cm RL by 3.0 cm SI, containing the 2 biopsy marker clips in its superior and central aspects. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The finding is best seen on series 2551 image 3, and series 25 images 1955 through 1976.   Overall, the MRI finding correlates with the extent/distribution of the mammogram architectural distortion containing the masses and marker clips.
There are multiple abnormal-appearing level 1 and level 2 axillary lymph nodes, one of which is the biopsy-proven metastatic lymph node and contains the (ribbon shaped on mammogram) biopsy marker (series 25 image 1938).
There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
