FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of extreme fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.The background enhancement has decreased markedly since administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
RIGHT BREAST: At 11:00, middle depth, 3 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with irregular margins, and heterogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 1 cm AP x 0.8 cm RL x  1.3 cm SI. . The enhancement is best seen on axial series 23 image 1940,  sagittal series 2351 image 134.
 There is no suspicious  lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST:
L1: At 12 o'clock, middle to posterior depth, 4 cm from the nipple, there is an oval mass with irregular margins, and heterogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 1.2 cm transverse,x 1.9 cm AP x 1.3 cm SI, previously  3.0 x 3.0 x 3.7 cm (transverse, AP, CC).The enhancement is best seen on axial peak contrast series 23,  image 1939.  This finding is the known cancer has a  scout fiducial marker within it.
L2: The previously seen mass 1.1 cm inferior to the L1 mass has resolved, previously measuring 1.2 cm in size. This finding has a  scout fiducial marker within it.
The enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla and the internal mammary lymphadenopathy are within normal limits after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. There is one left axillary lymph node containing a Scout fiducial within it. .
OTHER FINDINGS: There is an outer right lung mass on the T2 weighted images series 3 Image 97 and T1 noncontrast images series 2 image 102,  measuring 1.2 cm in size, also seen on PET CT of 7/19/2019.  I do not see the hyper- metabolic mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy seen on PET-CT
