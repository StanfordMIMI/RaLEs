FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of scattered fibroglandular tissue with minimal background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: 
L1: In the left breast centered at 11:00, 5 cm from nipple there is a heterogeneously enhancing irregular mass with internal necrosis measuring 5.9 x 5.6 x 5.5 cm. This mass occupies nearly the entirety of the upper inner quadrant of the left breast. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase  fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on axial peak contrast series 24,  image 1966. This is the patient's known biopsy-proven invasive ductal carcinoma. There is a Scout reflector marker clip located within the medial aspect of the mass.
L2: Extending anteriorly and laterally from the dominant L1 mass there is clumped nonmass enhancement measuring approximately 6.6 x 4.7 x 5.5 cm involving the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase  fast and delayed phase wash-out. This nonmass enhancement extends to the nipple and the skin and is best seen on series 2453 image 22.
Level 1 and level 2 left axillary confluent necrotic lymphadenopathy spanning approximately 6.8 x 8.3 x 4.3 cm. 
There is a prominent left internal mammary lymph node measuring 0.8 cm.
OTHER FINDINGS: There is a right chest wall port catheter with tip at the mid SVC.
