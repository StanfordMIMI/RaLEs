FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of extreme fibroglandular tissue with moderate background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST AND REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: Two biopsy markers are seen in the outer breast from prior benign biopsies of an area of homogeneous nonmass enhancement in the retroaroelar/central to 9:00 breast, anterior to posterior depth, which does not appear significantly changed compared to prior. Retroareolar duct ectasia with T1 hyperintense signal again seen. There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST AND REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: Retroareolar duct ectasia with T1 hyperintense signal again seen.
L1: There has been interval decrease in size of biopsy-proven malignancy at the 10:00 to 11:00 position, posterior depth, 9 cm from the nipple, where a residual irregular enhancing mass, with associated satellite lesions, is now seen collectively measuring approximately 2.9 x 1.9 x 2.9 cm, previously 3.5 x 2.5 x 3.5 cm. This is best seen on series 24 image 1965-1981, series 32200 image 101, and series 2453 image 47-48.  At the medial inferior aspect of this mass, a wing-shaped biopsy marker is present for biopsy-proven IDC. 
L2: At 10:00, 6.5 cm from the nipple (series 24, image 1947), a biopsy marker is seen (buckle shaped) corresponding to the site of previously biopsied malignancy representing IDC/DCIS, with the previously noted L2 mass no longer visible on the current study.
Multiple prominent left level I axillary lymph nodes are again seen, including a lymph node measuring 0.7 (AP) x 0.7 (ML) x 1.3 cm (CC) (series 24, image 1987 and series 2453, image 21), which is not significantly changed in size compared to prior. Adjacent to the anterior aspect of this lymph node, there is a wing-shaped biopsy marker for biopsy-proven metastatic carcinoma.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
