FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: At 9:00 middle depth, 3 cm from the nipple, there is segmental heterogeneous non mass enhancement, measuring 4.5 cm AP by 1.9 cm RL by 1.2 cm SI. The findings are best seen on series 23 image 1964.
There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: 
L1: At 2:00 middle to posterior depth 5 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with irregular margins and heterogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 3.9 cm AP by 3.6 cm RL by 3.1 cm SI. The findings are best seen on series 23 image 1956. There is a marker (top hat shaped on mammogram) in the superior aspect of the mass. 
There are at least 3 abnormal-appearing level 1 axillary lymph nodes (series 23 image 1925 and 1931).
There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
