FINDINGS: 
Scattered fibroglandular breast tissue with minimal background 
enhancement.
No lymphadenopathy.  Low signal in the marrow of the proximal humeri, 
presumed to be due to marrow expansion in the setting of 
chemotherapy.  Otherwise, unremarkable regional structures. 
LEFT:  Several prominent retroareolar ducts with intrinsic high 
signal and without abnormal enhancement, suggestive of duct ectasia.  
No suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to suggest invasive 
malignancy.
RIGHT: Marked interval decrease in size of the avidly enhancing mass 
corresponding to patient's known biopsy proven invasive ductal 
carcinoma at 10:00 o'clock with central signal void from post-biopsy 
metal marker approximately 4.3 cm from the base of the nipple, as 
seen on SUH US from 10/29/09.  This residual clumped mass enhancement 
(SL #R78.72-R96.3) now measures 2 cm x 1.5 cm from 4.5 x 3.4 cm on 
prior study.  Of note, areas of avid enhancement now demonstrate 
progressive kinetic curves.  Findings are suggestive of treatment 
response.  No new areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement.
