FINDINGS: 
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal that the right axillary lymph nodes are more prominent 
than the left axillary lymph nodes.  In particular, there is a 9 x 15 
mm axillary lymph node in series 404, slice locator 26.8 and a 
smaller adjacent lymph node.
 
The breasts are composed of dense tissue with mild background 
enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
There is a rim enhancing irregular mass with spiculations, measuring 
3.6 x 3.9 x 5.2 cm per outside report, in the right breast, 10 to 12 
o'clock position, 4 cm from the nipple.  Please note that prior 
outside ultrasound underestimates the size of this mass. A postbiopsy 
marker is identified at the superior lateral edge of the mass.  The 
mass is abutting the pectoralis muscle, but there is no MR evidence 
of involvement.
 
Elsewhere are several subcentimeter cysts.
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
There are no areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to 
suggest invasive malignancy.
 
A postbiopsy marker is identified in the left upper outer breast, in 
series 7, slice locator -98.9.  Note there is no abnormal mass or 
enhancement at this site.
 
Elsewhere are several subcentimeter cysts.
