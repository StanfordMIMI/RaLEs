FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of scattered fibroglandular tissue with minimal background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST AND REGIONAL LYMPH NODES:
There has been robust response to chemotherapy with decreased size and enhancement of R1, R2, and R3 masses as detailed below.
R1: The mass is no longer measurable at 1:00, posterior depth, 10 cm from the nipple. There is susceptibility artifact from the coil-shaped biopsy marker on series 23 image 1953.
R2: The mass is no longer measurable at retroareolar/central position, anterior depth, 0.2 cm from nipple. There is susceptibility artifact from the paddle-shaped biopsy marker on series 23 image 1967.
R3: Previously seen multiple masses spanning all 4 quadrants of the retroareolar breast are no longer seen. There is susceptibility artifact from a Savi Scout reflector on series 23 image 1971.
There is a T2 hyperintense retroareolar fluid collection, likely an evolving postbiopsy hematoma on series 3 image 139.
There are similar-appearing multiple mildly enlarged level 1 axillary lymph nodes. The largest measures 1.7 x 0.8 cm with susceptibility artifact from biopsy marker and series 23 image 1909, previously measuring 1.8 x 1.0 cm on the prior MRI (series 24 image 1914). Of note, this was previously biopsied with benign pathology on 8/13/2019.
LEFT BREAST AND REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
