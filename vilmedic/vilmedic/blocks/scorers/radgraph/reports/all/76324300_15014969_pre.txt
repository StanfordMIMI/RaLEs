FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with moderate background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts. There are intact bilateral subpectoral saline implants.
RIGHT BREAST: R1/R2/R3: Extending from 11:00-1:00, 3-5 cm from the nipple, there are 3 adjacent irregular masses that measure in conglomerate 2.9 x 5.2 x 2.9 cm (AP, transverse, CC). The outer of the 3 masses measures up to 1.8 cm and corresponds to the ultrasound core biopsy-proven malignant mass with ribbon marker (R1) at 11:00, 3 cm from the nipple. The centrally positioned of the 3 masses measures up to 2.7 cm and corresponds to the ultrasound core biopsy-proven malignant mass with ribbon marker at 12:00, 2 cm from the nipple. The inner mass has not been biopsied but can be presumed malignant, measuring up to 1.8 cm at 1:00, 4 cm from the nipple (R3). Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase washout. Findings are best visualized on series 23, image 1932.
R4: At 1 o'clock, posterior depth, 10 cm from the nipple, there is clumped non-mass enhancement in a linear distribution, measuring 2.6 cm AP x 0.5 cm RL x  0.6 cm SI. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase  fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on series 23,  image 1910.
R5: At 2:00 subareolar position, there is clumped nonmass enhancement in a segmental distribution that measures 2.1 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm (AP, transverse, cc). Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase washout. There is no associated nipple enhancement. Findings are best visualized on series 23, image 1855.
R6: At 8:00 subareolar position, there is clumped nonmass enhancement in a linear distribution that measures 2.1 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm (AP, transverse, cc). Worse-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase washout. There is no associated nipple enhancement. Findings are best visualized on series 23, image 1971.
There is no additional suspicious enhancement in the breast. There is no evidence of invasion of the pectoralis major or implant capsule. No evidence of skin involvement or nipple involvement.
There are numerous abnormal level 1 and level 2 right axillary lymph nodes, the largest of which has a SaviScout marker internally. No internal mammary lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
