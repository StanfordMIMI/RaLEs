FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of scattered fibroglandular tissue with moderate background parenchymal enhancement that is asymmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: At 1 o'clock, middle depth, 5.7 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with circumscribed margins, and heterogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 1.5 x 1.6 x 2.4 cm. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The mass is best seen on axial peak contrast DISCO series image 1942, and sagittal peak series image 20. Susceptibility from biopsy marker clip is visualized 4 mm anterior to this mass (series 26, image 1943). Of note, this mass represents pathology proven invasive ductal carcinoma.
There is also an abnormal-appearing right axillary lymph node measuring 1.9 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm with abnormal architecture and susceptibility artifact from under clip placement (series 26, image 1954). Of note, this lymph node was positive for metastatic disease on biopsy.
LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
