FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with minimal background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
There is a biopsy marker (top-hat) in the right anterior 10:00 position, 3 cm from the nipple, from reported outside hospital benign breast biopsy. 
R1: At 11 o'clock, middle depth, 5-6 cm from the nipple, there is homogeneous non-mass enhancement in a focal distribution, measuring 0.8 x 0.4 x 1.1 cm. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on axial peak contrast DISCO series image 1937, and sagittal peak series image 55. There is no suspicious lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: 
L1: At left upper upper outer and inner breast, anterior to middle depth as well as the left lower outer breast, middle to posterior depth, 1.3-12 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with irregular margins, and heterogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 5.8 x 9.5 x 8.0 cm. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The mass is best seen on axial peak contrast DISCO series image 1935, and sagittal peak series image 15. Biopsy marker (Cork) is seen in the anterolateral aspect of the mass at the 2:00 position, 4 cm from the nipple. There is associated skin thickening and edema.
There are at least 3 abnormal left axillary level 1 lymph nodes, the largest of which measures up to 2.4 cm and contains a top-hat biopsy marker.
There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: There is a right chest port in place.
