FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal stable prominent left axillary lymph nodes. Previous 
ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy of one representative 
lymph node was negative. A right Mediport is also identified.
 
The breasts are composed of scattered fibroglandular tissue with mild 
background enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
There are scattered nonspecific gradually enhancing foci. 
 
Previously identified focus in the upper outer quadrant, slice 
locator S 43.4 on the October 2010 study, is seen today on series 
700, image 57, and is stable.
 
Previously identified focus at the 9 o'clock position, slice locator 
S 36.5 on the October 2010 study, is seen today on series 700, image 
60, and is stable.
 
Previously identified focus in the retroareolar/central region, slice 
locator S 28.5 on the October 2010 study, is seen today on series 
700, image 61, and is stable.
 
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
The index cancer at the 5 o'clock position, areolar border, 
demonstrates overall decrease in size from the 3 x 4.2 x 3.3 cm to 
3.2 x 2.8 x 3.5 cm. The cancer has a bilobed appearance with the 
superior component markedly decreasing in size to 1.6 cm and the 
inferior component increasing in size to 3.1 cm. There is also 
suggestion of increased involvement of the overlying skin by the 
inferior component.
 
Previously identified suspicious non-masslike enhancement extending 
posteriorly from the index cancer is not definitely identified on 
this study.
