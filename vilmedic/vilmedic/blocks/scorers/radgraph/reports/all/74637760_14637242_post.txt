FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST:
R1: At 7 o'clock, middle depth, 5.0 cm from the nipple, there is an oval mass with circumscribed margins, and homogeneous internal enhancement, that is T2 hyperintense, measuring 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm (AP x RL x CC), previously 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase plateau. The enhancement is best seen on series 24, image 1992. Stable compared to prior examination.
There is no lymphadenopathy or additional suspicious enhancement.
LEFT BREAST: 
L1: Previously identified multiple confluent irregular masses with spiculated margins, and heterogeneous internal enhancement occupying all four quadrants and extending from anterior to middle depth, previously measuring 4.8 cm AP x 5.3 cm RL x 8.0 cm SI demonstrates no residual enhancement on today's exam. There is a (ribbon) marker clip at 12:00 o'clock, 3.7 cm from the nipple.
Mild residual diffuse skin thickening is present.
Significant interval decrease in size of level 1 through 3 axillary lymph nodes and an abnormal interpectoral lymph node. The most prominent axillary lymph node is a level 1 node measuring 0.6 cm in short axis (24/1954).
Interval resolution of the previously identified two abnormal internal mammary lymph nodes.
No new lymphadenopathy or suspicious enhancement.
OTHER FINDINGS: Right chest wall Mediport in place.
