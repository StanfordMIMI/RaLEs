FINDINGS:   Axial T1 weighted images demonstrate a subpectoral lymph 
node on the right with normal fatty hila.  No morphologically 
abnormal lymph nodes are seen within the axilla or mediastinum.   
Regional structures are grossly unremarkable. 
 
 RIGHT BREAST:   An abnormal enhancing mass lesion is located in the 
right breast at the 11-12:00 o'clock position approximately 2.5 cm 
from the nipple, best seen on slice locators R76.3-R89.9.   This 
slightly irregularly marginated lesion measures approximately 2 x 2 
cm.   Susceptibility artifact seen centrally within this lesion may 
reflect blood or gas from biopsy versus a marker which can be 
correlated for any history of placement.   This mass demonstrates 
rapid washin and washout and is consistent with the patient's known 
history of breast cancer.   There are no additional focal masses or 
areas of abnormal enhancement within the right breast.   
 
 LEFT BREAST:   There is no evidence of focal dominant mass, abnormal 
enhancement, or architectural distortion within the left breast.
