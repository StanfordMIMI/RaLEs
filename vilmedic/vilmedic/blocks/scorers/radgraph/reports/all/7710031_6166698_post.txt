FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal scarring in the right axilla without evidence of 
lymphadenopathy. A left chest central venous port is present.
 
The breasts are composed of dense tissue with minimal background 
enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
The index cancer has decreased in size, now measuring 1.7 x 1.0 x 
0.9cm in the central right breast 3.9cm from the nipple (previously 
1.8 x 2.9 x 2.2cm) seen on series 7, image 34, slice locator R87.6.  
It is more gradually enhancing.   The ribbon shaped post biopsy 
marker is immediately medial and inferior to the mass. The far 
posterior surface of the mass is located 18mm posterior to the ribbon 
marker. 
 
There in an additional omega shaped marker in the subcutaneous tissue 
of the lateral right breast. 
 
Elsewhere in the right breast, there are no additional areas of 
suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to suggest invasive 
malignancy.
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
There are no areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to 
suggest invasive malignancy.
