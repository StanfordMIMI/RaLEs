FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: 
L1 and L2: At 12:00-3:00, anterior-middle depth, 3-7 cm from the nipple, there is substantial decrease in the multiple adjacent spiculated masses, which now form segmental clumped nonmass enhancement the measures 1.2 x 4.5 x 1.8 cm (transverse, AP, CC). The scout reflector is noted in the superior/posterior aspect of the mass (series 23, image 1928). The extent of the nonmass enhancement is best visualized on series 23, image 1937 and series 2353, image 49-56. The enhancement extends at least 3 cm anterior/inferior to the Scout. 
L3: Scout reflector noted at  6:00 position, 1 cm from the nipple from discordant benign biopsy. No abnormal enhancement.
L4: At 10-11 o'clock, posterior depth, 7 cm from the nipple, there is decrease in the spiculated mass, which now measures 0.4 cm on series 23, image 1932. No biopsy done.
No additional suspicious enhancement.
There is no lymphadenopathy, with a postbiopsy Scout noted in an otherwise normal-appearing left axillary lymph node (series 23, image 1897), reflecting the biopsy-proven metastatic lymph node.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
