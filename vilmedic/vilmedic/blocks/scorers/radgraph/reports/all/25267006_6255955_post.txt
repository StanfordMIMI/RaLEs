FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal no significant abnormality.  A right-sided central 
venous catheter is present. The previously seen enlarged left 
axillary lymph node has resolved.
 
The breasts are composed of heterogeneously dense tissue with 
moderate scattered foci of background enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
There are no areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to 
suggest invasive malignancy. Multiple cysts are again seen in the 
right breast.
 
LEFT BREAST:
There has been significant interval response to therapy.  No residual 
enhancing abnormalities are identified in left breast.  A post biopsy 
metal marker is again seen in the upper inner quadrant of the left 
breast.
 
Elsewhere in the left breast, there are no new areas of suspicious 
mass or non-mass enhancement to suggest invasive malignancy.
