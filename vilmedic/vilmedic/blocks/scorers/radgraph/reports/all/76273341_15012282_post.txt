FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of extreme fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST AND REGIONAL LYMPH NODES:
R1: At 9-10 o'clock, posterior depth, 5 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with spiculated margins, and homogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 5.8 cm AP x 3.4 cm RL x  4.7 cm SI. Much of the measurement of R1 is an aggregate measurement of scattered remnants; the overall bulk of the mass has significantly decreased compared to 6/17/2019. The largest focal area of enhancement is just posterior to the marker, measuring 1.3 cm AP x 1.9 cm RL x 1.9 cm SI (series 23, image 1954). Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out; this washout kinetics is seen primarily in the mass posterior to the marker. The enhancement is best seen on series 23,  image 1938-1967.
There is no suspicious lymphadenopathy. Previously abnormal lymph nodes in the right axilla have normalized. The previously biopsied clip shows susceptibility artifact from the clip.
LEFT BREAST AND REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: The marrow of the sternum  and visible ribs demonstrate shows diffuse low T1 signal, high T2 signal  and homogeneous enhancement, new compared to 6/17/2019.
