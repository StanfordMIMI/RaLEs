FINDINGS:  
 
OUTSIDE BREAST MRI: 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal an enlarged left axillary lymph node measuring 1.6 x 
1.3 cm, best appreciated on series 15, slice locator 74.7.
The breasts are composed of scattered fibroglandular breast tissue 
with moderate background enhancement.
 
Right Breast:
 
There are no areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to 
suggest invasive malignancy.  There are several scattered nonspecific 
foci constituting the moderate background enhancement.  We do not 
have enhancement kinetics information.
 
Left Breast:
 
There is a 2.9 x 3.1 cm irregular heterogeneously enhancing mass in 
the left upper outer quadrant, 8 cm from nipple.  Per outside report, 
demonstrates type II and type III enhancement kinetics.  This mass is 
consistent with reported invasive ductal carcinoma.
 
There are several subcentimeter enhancing masses anterior to the main 
mass consistent with satellite lesions.  In total, the main mass and 
satellite lesions encompass a maximal dimension of a 6 cm (AP).
 
There are also two linear bands of enhancing tissue, best seen on 
series 15, slice locator 0.71 and 9.7.
 
In addition, there are several enhancing foci extending more 
anteriorly towards the nipple.  Although these are nonspecific given 
the moderate background enhancement, given the relative proximity to 
the index cancer, further disease cannot be excluded.
