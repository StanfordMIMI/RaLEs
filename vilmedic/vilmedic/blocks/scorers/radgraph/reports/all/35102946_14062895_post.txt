FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of extreme fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: Interval resolution of previously visualized nonmass enhancement at the R1 site. There are biopsy marker clips in the anterior and posterior aspects of the previously visualized and biopsied R1 findings at 6-7 o'clock. 
There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: Unchanged 0.6 cm circumscribed oval T2 hyperintense mass at the 11:00 position, posterior depth, again consistent with a benign intramammary lymph node. There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: Partially visualized RIGHT-sided PICC line. There is again minimal anterior mediastinal soft tissue compatible with thymic tissue.
