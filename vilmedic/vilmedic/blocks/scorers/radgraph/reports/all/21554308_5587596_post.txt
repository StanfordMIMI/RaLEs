FINDINGS:  Axial T1 images demonstrate several lymph nodes on the 
left with one of the lymph nodes measuring 1-cm and demonstrating 
increased thickness of the cortex best seen on series 2, image #24, 
slice locator 40.4. There is a right chest Mediport. There is a 
questionable hypointense area in the dome of the liver, which 
measures 2.0 x 1.7-cm, however, there is no correlate on prior CT and 
it is questionable if this represents a real finding versus artifact. 
 
LEFT BREAST:  There is a 1-cm mass in the lower outer quadrant of the 
left breast, which demonstrates abnormal contrast enhancement and is 
containing a post-biopsy clip, located approximately 4.7- cm from the 
nipple in series 207, image #19, slice locator L113.6 and corresponds 
to the known cancer seen on prior mammogram and ultrasound. There is 
abnormal enhancement identified inferior to the lesion and it likely 
represents the prior biopsy track with hemosiderin.
