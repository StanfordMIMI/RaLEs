FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of scattered fibroglandular tissue with moderate background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: At 12 o'clock, anterior depth, 2 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with irregular margins, and homogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 1.6 cm AP x 1.3 cm RL x  1.5 cm SI. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on series 24, image 1952, and series 2452, image 51. A biopsy marker clip is noted within the posterior aspect of the mass, which likely represents triple negative breast cancer per provided history. 
R2: Extending from 7:00 to 11:00, middle to posterior depth, there is heterogeneous non-mass enhancement in a regional distribution, measuring 10.8 cm AP x 2.2 cm RL x  5.6 cm SI. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on series 24, image 1963, and series 2451, image 19.
In the right axilla, there is an enlarged lymph node with abnormal morphology measuring 1.5 cm (series 24, image 1909, and series 2452, image 31).
LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
