FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal a normally enlarged left level 3 lymph node measuring 
16 mm in short axis and additional enlarged axillary lymph node 
measuring 20 mm in short axis consistent with prior ultrasound on 
October 31, 2011 and prior CT dated December 7 2011 
 
The breasts are composed of scattered fibroglandular tissue with 
minimal scattered foci of background enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
T2 bright focus of minimal contrast enhancement seen series 4 image 
66 is consistent with intramammary lymph node stable in comparison 
with prior mammographic images dated December 2011 and October 2005. 
There are no areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to 
suggest invasive malignancy.
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
L1: Previously described known malignancy in the left upper inner 
breast 8 cm from the nipple is seen on MRI as a region of mass 
non-masslike rapid enhancement with washout measuring 5 x 2.6 x 2.8 
cm. This abnormality encompasses the described abnormalities on 
ultrasound including the described satellite lesion and measures a 
larger area on the current examination.
 
L2: A small 5-mm T2 bright focus of rapid contrast enhancement with 
plateau is seen at series 25 image 3202 at 3 o'clock 9 cm from the 
nipple and probably represents a benign process, likely fibroadenoma. 
 
No MR correlate of the described palpable abnormality in the left 
upper outer breast (reported 1:00).
