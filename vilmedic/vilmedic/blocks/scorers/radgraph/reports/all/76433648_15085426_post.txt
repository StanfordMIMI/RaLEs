FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with minimal background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST AND REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: There is susceptibility artifact from nipple jewelry that precludes evaluation of the nipple areolar complex and periareolar breast. There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST AND REGIONAL LYMPH NODES:
 
L1: At 2:00, middle depth, 8 cm from the nipple, there is a biopsy marker (buckle-shaped) at the site of biopsy-proven malignancy (series 23, image 1953). The prior MRI mass has largely resolved. There are 3 foci of enhancement adjacent to the biopsy marker that measure up to 0.5 cm (series 53, image 206), spanning up to 1.7 cm RL (series 23, image 1949).
L2: At 2:00, anterior depth, 2-3 cm from the nipple, there is a biopsy marker (cork-shaped) at the site of biopsy-proven malignancy (series 23, image 1967). The prior MRI mass is no longer present.
L3: At retroareolar/central breast, middle depth, the previously seen 2 adjacent round masses now measure 0.2 cm each (series 23, image 1969), decreased from 0.8 cm previously, and are located 1.1 cm AP apart. These masses have not been previously biopsied.
The previously identified enhancement of the nipple areolar complex and adjacent skin has decreased significantly. 
The biopsy-proven metastatic level 1 axillary lymph node with adjacent biopsy marker now appears morphologically normal, measuring 5 mm in long axis (series 23 image 1943). 
There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
