FINDINGS: 
Overview: Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images 
of the breast reveal: abnormal dense right axillary lymph nodes 
located high in the axilla deep to the pectoralis muscle.  The 
largest abnormal lymph node measures 1.9 cm.  Benign appearing left 
axillary nodes are noted.
Breast composition: Predominantly fatty breast tissue.
Background enhancement: mild     background enhancement.
A signal void is seen in the proximal right humerus, of uncertain 
clinical significance.
A 1 cm focus of high signal in the left liver (3/29, slice locator 
-68.70) is of uncertain clinical significance.
 
Right Breast:
 
A 2.45 x 2.58 cm spiculated enhancing masses seen in the outer right 
breast in the area of reported malignancy (7/35, SL85.1).  
Posteroinferior to this mass is an ovoid enhancing focus, measuring 
3.4 x 8.6 mm, located 13.5 cm from the nipple, most consistent with 
an intramammary lymph node (7/35, SL85.1).
Left Breast:
 
There is a benign appearing intramammary lymph node, measuring 0.5 
mm, in the left breast upper outer quadrant (7/10, SL -94.8)  No 
areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to suggest invasive 
malignancy.
