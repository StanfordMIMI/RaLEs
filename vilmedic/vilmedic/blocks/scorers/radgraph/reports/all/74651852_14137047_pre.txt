FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: Involving all 4 quadrants and the central/subareolar breast, extending from anterior to posterior depth, there is a large irregular mass (measuring up to 7.0 cm) with associated confluent anterior and posterior non mass enhancement. In total, the areas of enhancement span 7.5 cm AP by 7.0 cm RL by 8.0 cm SI. Anteriorly, enhancement extends to the nipple, and there is nipple inversion or retraction. Posteriorly, enhancement extends to 0.5 cm from the pectoralis major muscle (series 23 image 1953). There is also associated diffuse skin thickening.  The findings are best seen on series 2350 image 2, and series 23 including image 1945.
The marker clips at sites of biopsy are at 10:00 3 cm from the nipple and at 11:00 3 cm from the nipple.
There is a single abnormal-appearing level 1 axillary lymph node, measuring up to 1.9 cm, which contains a marker clip and is biopsy proven malignant/metastatic (series 23 image 1906).
There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
