FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of extreme fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: At 10 o'clock, mid to posterior depth, 6 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with irregular margins consistent with biopsy-proven malignant mass which demonstrates significant interval decrease in size now measuring 2.0 cm AP x 1.2 cm RL x  1.8 cm SI. There is no discernible internal enhancement within the mass. There is a biopsy marker clip located within the mass.
Interval decrease in size of previously visualized prominent right axillary lymph nodes which are now normal in appearance.
LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: Stable T2 hyperintense lesion in a mid thoracic vertebral body measuring 0.8 cm, incompletely evaluated, but likely vertebral hemangiomas.
