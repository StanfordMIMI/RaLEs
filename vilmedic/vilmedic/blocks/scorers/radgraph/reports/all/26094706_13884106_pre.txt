FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with moderate background parenchymal enhancement that is asymmetric between right greater than left both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
For the purposes of this dictation, the previously biopsied R1 and R2 malignancies will be categorized collectively as R1.
In the retroareolar/central to 11:00 breast, middle depth, 2-8 cm from the nipple, there is heterogeneous mass and non-mass enhancement in a segmental distribution. Given the extent of background enhancement and ill-defined borders of the finding, it is difficult to delineate the abnormality and any potential satellite lesions from background. Additionally, post biopsy site changes cannot be entirely excluded. The area of worst-curve kinetics with initial phase  fast and delayed phase wash-out roughly measures 2 AP x 1.5 TV x 2.5 CC cm. The enhancement is best seen on axial MIP series 29, image 5256 and sagittal MIP series 2352, image 52.This area encompasses the markers from the R1 and R2 biopsy sites at the anterior and posterior extents.  
There are scattered T2 bright foci and masses, many of which are compatible with cysts.
 There is no suspicious  lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: There are scattered T2 bright foci and masses, many of which are compatible with cysts. There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: There is a 1.1 cm hyperintensity in the left inferior renal pole which is favored to represent a cyst and is seen on localizer view only.
