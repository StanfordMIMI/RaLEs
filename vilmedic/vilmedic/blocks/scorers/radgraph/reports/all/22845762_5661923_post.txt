FINDINGS: 
Overview: Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images 
of the breast reveal no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes. Previously 
slightly prominent left axillary lymph nodes are now normal in 
appearance.
Breast composition: Heterogeneously dense fibroglandular breast 
tissue.
Background enhancement: no  background enhancement.
 
Right Breast:
 
No areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to suggest 
invasive malignancy. Two tiny punctate ( 1 mm) foci of benign 
enhancement are unchanged.
 
Left Breast:
 
There has been a dramatic decrease in the size of the previous tumor.  
The only faintly enhancing residual abnormality is a 14.5 mm diameter 
mass at 12:00 position, series 7, image 133 centered 7 cm from the 
nipple.  This has a clip centrally, and corresponds to the mass seen 
on US of 7-12-2010, allowing for expected differences in breast 
position.
