FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of extreme fibroglandular tissue with moderate background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: No suspicious mass or suspicious enhancement seen.
LEFT BREAST: At 10 o'clock, middle and posterior depth, 7.0 cm from the nipple (measured from center of mass), there is an irregular mass with spiculated margins, and heterogeneous internal enhancement and nonenhancing cystic areas within the center reflecting central necrosis, measuring approximately 4.5 x 4.3 x 4.9 cm (transverse x AP x craniocaudal). Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on axial peak contrast series 23,  image 1947. The posterior most margin of the mass comes within 0.5 cm of the pectoralis muscle without evidence of pectoralis invasion.
OTHER FINDINGS: There is a single left axillary lymph node with minimal cortical thickening measuring 4.5 mm (image 1,907, series 23). If clinically indicated, ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy can be performed. No internal mammary lymphadenopathy seen.
