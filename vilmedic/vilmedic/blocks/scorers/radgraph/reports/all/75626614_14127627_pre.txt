FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of scattered fibroglandular tissue with minimal background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: Moderate right breast and skin edema, with skin thickening Approximately 3.9 x 2.9 x 5.0 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right outer breast at 9:00, approximately 7 cm from the nipple correlating with previously described R1 mass (series 23, image 1966), with central necrosis. Focus of susceptibility artifact within the central to anterior aspect of the mass correlates with previously placed tophat biopsy marker clip. 
2.6 cm anterior to the center of R1, there is an approximately 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm heterogeneously enhancing nodule, approximately 4.0 cm from the nipple, which likely corresponds to previously described R2 (series 23, image 1949).
Superomedial to and less than 0.5 cm from the edge of R1 , there are are at least 2 satellite nodules, measuring approximately 1.2 x 0.9 x 1.0 cm, and 0.9 x 0.9 x 1.0 cm (series 2352J, image 43).
Medial to but abutting R1 and R2 in the central breast, anterior and middle depth, there is probable nonmass enhancement measuring approximately 4.7 x 3.8 x 5.0 cm (series 23, image 1955).
In the inferior breast at 6:00, 8.0 cm from the nipple, there is an additional 0.8 cm heterogeneously enhancing nodule/lymph node (series 23, image 1990).
Marked right axillary lymphadenopathy with necrosis, for example a necrotic lymph node measuring 3.4 x 2.8 x 3.5 cm (series 23, 1924), and an adjacent necrotic lymph node measuring 2.9 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm (series 23, image 1915).
 LEFT BREAST: Susceptibility artifact in the left breast at 2:00, from previous cork biopsy marker clip placement. There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: In the right medial lung, there is a question 0.7 cm pulmonary nodule (series 23, 1936).
