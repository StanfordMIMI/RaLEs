FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with marked background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts. Multiple scattered simple cysts are seen in both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: There is a lymph node in the left axilla that has thickened cortices best seen on axial series 23 image 1894 measuring 1 cm in size, with smaller lymph nodes measuring 0.8 cm in size best seen on series 23 image 1885. 
L1: There is a coil biopsy marker clip located in the left breast at 10:00, 5 cm from the nipple at site of prior biopsy of calcifications demonstrating invasive ductal carcinoma. There is heterogeneous nonmass enhancement measuring 5.3 x 5.2 x 3.2 cm involving both the upper and inner quadrant of the left breast. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase  fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on axial peak contrast series 23,  image 1969. and sagittal series 2351 image 36 The biopsy marker clip is located centrally within this nonmass enhancement. The nonmass enhancement extends approximately 2 cm in all directions surrounding the biopsy marker clip.
L2: At 5 o'clock, middle depth, 3 cm from the nipple, there is heterogeneous non-mass enhancement in a segmental distribution, measuring 4.0 x 3.8 x 0.9 cm. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase  fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on axial peak contrast series 23,  image 1984 and sagittal series 2351 image 29..
There is a biopsy ribbon marker clip in the left axilla located within a normal-appearing lymph node in the upper left breast best seen on the sagittal projection series 2351 image 32..
 There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
