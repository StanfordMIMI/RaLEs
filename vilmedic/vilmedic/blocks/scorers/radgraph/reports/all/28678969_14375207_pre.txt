FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of extreme fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is asymmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: There are benign findings of lumpectomy. There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy. 
LEFT BREAST: 
L1: Extending from 1:00 to 3:00, from anterior to middle depth, anteriorly 2 from the nipple, there is clumped and clustered ring non-mass enhancement, spanning 5.0 cm AP 2.5 cm RL by 5.0 cm SI . Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase  fast and delayed phase wash-out. The marker clip is at the biopsy site within the non-mass enhancement at 2 o'clock 4 cm from the nipple, and is relatively centered AP/RL/SI in the enhancing area. The findings are best seen on series 2350 image 2, series 23 image 1945, and series 2351L image 32. The MRI size is significantly larger than the 1.0 cm appreciable on mammogram.
There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
