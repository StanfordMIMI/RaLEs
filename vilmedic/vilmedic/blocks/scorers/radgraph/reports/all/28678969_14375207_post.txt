FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of extreme fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is asymmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy. Benign findings related to prior lumpectomy.
LEFT BREAST: Redemonstration of clustered ring non-mass enhancement extending from the 1:00 to 3:00 location, anterior to middle depth, which now measures approximately 4.5 cm AP by 1.7 cm RL by 4 cm SI, previously 5.0 cm AP by 2.5 cm  by 5.0 cm. The nonmass enhancement is less confluent. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. Area of susceptibility at the 2:00 position, 4 cm from the nipple, corresponding to cork biopsy marker clip in this region. In addition, there are two other foci of susceptibility in the right breast corresponding to additional biopsy marker clips at the 2:00 position, 3 cm from the nipple and 6 cm from the nipple, respectively.  
OTHER FINDINGS: Postsurgical changes in the left upper abdominal quadrant related to prior gastric procedures.
