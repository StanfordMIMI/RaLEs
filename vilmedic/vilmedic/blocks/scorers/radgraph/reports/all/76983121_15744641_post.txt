FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of scattered fibroglandular tissue with minimal background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST AND REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: Few scattered cysts. There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST AND REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: 
L1 and L2 located at the 2 o'clock position at anterior to middle depth starting from 5 cm from the nipple were previously comprised of confluent masses and non mass enhancement with post biopsy marker clips in its superior and central aspects on the 10/14/2019 MRI.  
The L1 and L2  enhancement is now decreased in both degree of enhancement and extent. There is now small amount of enhancement around the anterior postbiopsy ribbon marker seen is a signal void ( series 23 image 1946) with nonmass enhancement extending between the 2 markers measuring 3 cm in anterior posterior dimension, including the posterior signal void from the dumbbell shaped marker seen best on series 2351 image 159. In total the R1/R2 finding measures approximately 3.7 (AP) x 1.5 (RL) x 2.9 (SI) cm, decreased in the RL dimension compared to 10/14/2019 (3.0 cm previously). 
There is decreased size of left level 1 and 2 lymph nodes, which are now normal size and normal morphology. A ribbon -shaped biopsy marker is seen as a signal void, associated with one of the lymph nodes, which was biopsy-proven metastatic malignancy (series 23, image 1982). This lymph node is now normal in appearance.
OTHER FINDINGS: Stable subcentimeter nonenhancing T2 lesion in the left hepatic lobe most consistent with a hepatic cyst.
