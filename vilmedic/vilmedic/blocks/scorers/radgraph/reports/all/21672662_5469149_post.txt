FINDINGS: Axial T1 images demonstrate lymph nodes in the left 
axillary region, which are overall grossly stable compared to the 
06/18/09 exam. 
 
LEFT BREAST: In the left inner/lower breast, there is a clip artifact 
best seen on series 5, slice -73.3, which corresponds to the recent 
stereotactic core biopsy which demonstrated benign pathology for 
calcifications. In the left upper outer breast in the area of known 
cancer, there is a biopsy clip artifact noted. This tumor previously 
measured 3.7 x 2.1 cm on 06/18/09 breast MR and now measures 2.9 x 
0.8 cm. There is residual gradual enhancement kinetic curve, which 
suggests significant interval response to treatment. 
 
RIGHT BREAST: In the right lower outer breast, there is a clip 
artifact seen on series 4, image 22, slice locater 117; however, 
there is no associated abnormal enhancement.  The pathology of this 
biopsy is unknown.
