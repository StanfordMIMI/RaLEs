FINDINGS: 
There is a 1.6 x 0.8 cm enlarged lymph node in the right axilla 
series 2 image 21, grossly similar in size and appearance compared to 
1/15/2010 series 2 image 16 and has been previously biopsied.  
Elsewhere, there is no new adenopathy.
 
Unremarkable extramammary regional structures. 
 
RIGHT BREAST: 
 
There is significant interval decrease in size of the previously 
noted cancer in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast which 
measures approximately 2.8 x 2.4 cm compared to 4.9 x 4.0 cm on the 
MR exam 1/15/2010. There is stippled enhancement with rapid wash in 
and plateau (eg SL 111.2 and SL114.6) in a ductal distribution over a 
region approximately 5-cm in the anterior to posterior dimension 
worrisome for DCIS (1.7 cm posterior and 2.6 cm anteriorly to the 
index cancer).
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
No areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to suggest 
invasive malignancy.  Nonspecific foci which demonstrate gradual 
enhancement are seen in the left breast (eg SL 89.9 and SL 83.1).
