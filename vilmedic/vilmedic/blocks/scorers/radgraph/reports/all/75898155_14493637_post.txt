FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of scattered fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: 
L1:At 12-1 o'clock 4 cm from the nipple, there is a a biopsy marker, which appears ribbon shaped, at the site of biopsy proven malignancy. The prior MRI masses and non mass enhancement, which were located predominantly in the upper and subareolar/central breast and spanned up to 8.5 cm, has largely resolved. There is are small areas of focal non mass enhancement, located at 12-1:00 adjacent to the biopsy marker spanning 1.5 cm (series 32200 image 72), and at 6:00 2.5 cm caudal to the biopsy marker, spanning 1.0 cm (series 3-2 00 image 104). 
The previously seen L2 and L3 enhancing MRI findings are no longer present.
The nipple retraction has resolved, and the diffuse skin thickening has significantly decreased.
The level 1 axillary lymph nodes now appear morphologically normal. 
There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
