FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal mildly prominent lymph nodes in both axilla.  
Incidentally noted, there is a small 8mm likely hemangioma in the mid 
thoracic spine, seen only on the localizer images, unchanged from the 
prior exam. There is a stable 9 x 6mm sternal lesion with imaging 
characteristics compatible with a hemangioma, as previously 
described. 
 
The breasts are composed of dense tissue with minimal background 
enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
There has been interval resolution of the previously described 3mm 
focus of enhancement in the right breast 6 o'clock adjacent to 2 post 
biopsy metal markers.  There are no new areas of suspicious mass or 
non-mass enhancement to suggest invasive malignancy.
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
There are no areas of suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement to 
suggest invasive malignancy.
