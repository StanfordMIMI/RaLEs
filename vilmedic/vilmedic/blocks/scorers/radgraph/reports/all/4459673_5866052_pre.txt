FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveal a left breast mass. There are no pathologically 
enlarged axillary nor supraclavicular lymph nodes. The visualized 
lung parenchyma and osseous structures are unremarkable..
 
The breasts are composed of predominantly fatty tissue with minimal 
scattered foci of background enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
There are multiple nonspecific foci measuring < 5 mm scattered 
throughout the right breast (approximately 4 total) which demonstrate 
slow persistent enhancement. There are no areas of suspicious mass 
nor non-mass enhancement to suggest invasive malignancy.
 
LEFT BREAST:
There is a round mass with irregular margins measuring 3.9 x 2.6 x 
2.2 cm (AP x transverse x craniocaudal) which demonstrates rapid 
wash-in and wash-out enhancement within the outer quadrant of the 
left breast, in the 3 o'clock position, approximately 8 cm from the 
nipple (series 7, image 21 - slice locator L123.7). There is clumped 
ductal enhancement extending approximately 15 mm anteriorly and 8 mm 
posteriorly from this mass lesion suspicious for ductal carcinoma in 
situ. There are no additional areas of suspicious mass nor non-mass 
enhancement within the left breast.
