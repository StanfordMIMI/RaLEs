FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of scattered fibroglandular tissue with moderate background parenchymal enhancement that is asymmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: At 1 o'clock, middle depth, 6.7 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with irregular obstetric margins, and heterogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 0.9 x 0.4 x 1.2 cm. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on axial peak contrast series 1954,  image 52. Susceptibility from biopsy marker clip is visualized 4 mm anterior to this mass (series 27, image 1956). Of note, this mass represents pathology proven invasive ductal carcinoma. It is smaller than on the prior examination of August 15, 2018 when it measured 1.5 x 1.6 x 2.4 cm.
There is a abnormal appearing right axillary lymph node measuring 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm with abnormal architecture and susceptibility artifact from clip placement (series 27, image 1938; series 2752, image 56). Of note, this lymph node was positive for metastatic disease on biopsy. This lymph node is also smaller than on prior examination when it measured 1.9 cm in size.
LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
