FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: 
L1: There is stable appearance from the most recent MRI irregular spiculated enhancing mass at 10:00, middle depth, 7 cm from the nipple which measures 2.8 x 2.2 x 2.2 cm TV x AP x SI. While the overall measurement has not significantly changed, the enhancement of this mass is less confluent than on prior study. The mass is best appreciated on series 23, image 1950-1959. Worse curve kinetics are initial phase medium and delayed phase plateau. The cork shaped biopsy marker is at the medial aspect of the mass.
A biopsy marker is noted next to a morphologically normal level 1 axillary lymph node.
There is nonenhancing intrinsic T1-weighted intraductal signal which is similar from comparison and may represent intraductal proteinaceous material or blood products.
There is no other suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: Right-sided chest port tip terminates in the midsuperior vena cava.
