FINDINGS:
RIGHT BREAST AND REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: 
The right breast is composed of extreme fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement.
R1: At right axilla, 10:30 o'clock, 10-14 cm from the nipple, there is minimal linear residual enhancement, previously an irregular mass with spiculated margins, and heterogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 4.0 cm AP x 2.0 cm RL x  2.5 cm SI. The mass contains 2 biopsy marker clips placed on 8/5/2019 biopsy labeled R1 and R3. The entire mass will be subsequently called R1.
Decrease in prominence of axillary lymphadenopathy with the most prominent lymph node measuring 2 mm in cortical thickness (23/1913). 
There is susceptibility artifact from a coil-shaped biopsy marker in the retroareolar breast. 
There is susceptibility artifact in the right breast at 12:00, 5 cm from the nipple, likely corresponding to a post biopsy marker adjacent to coarse calcifications on mammogram. Core biopsy on 9/6/2011 was benign.
There is an MRI swap artifact in the outer breast (23/1993). There is no other suspicious enhancement.
LEFT BREAST AND REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: There are benign findings of left mastectomy and tissue flap reconstruction. There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
OTHER FINDINGS: Multiple stable T2 hyperintense liver lesions, incompletely characterized, please see dedicated CT and PET/CT dated 8/28/2019 for further characterization. Left chest wall Mediport in place. Diffuse T2 hyperintense marrow signal with associated enhancement favored to be related to treatment-related effects from chemotherapy.
