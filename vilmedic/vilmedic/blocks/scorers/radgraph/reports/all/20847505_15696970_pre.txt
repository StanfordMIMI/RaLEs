FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of extreme fibroglandular tissue with moderate background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST: 
R1: At retroareolar/central to 9:00, anterior to posterior depth, 1-10 cm from the nipple, there is homogeneous non-mass enhancement in a segmental distribution, measuring 8.9 cm AP x 3.3 cm RL x  1.9 cm SI. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase  fast and delayed phase plateau. The enhancement is best seen on series 23,  image 1962-1975. It is also seen on series 2353 image 40.
There is retroareolar ductal ectasia with T1 hyperintense signal.
There is no suspicious lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: 
L1: At 10-11 o'clock, posterior depth, 9 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular mass with spiculated margins, and homogeneous internal enhancement and susceptibility artifact from biopsy marking clip and its inferior medial aspect. This is the site of biopsy-proven malignancy. 3 adjacent similar-appearing spiculated masses are noted. When taken together, the masses measure 3.5 cm AP x 2.5 cm RL x  3.5 cm SI. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on series 23,  image 1924-1949.
L2: At 10 o'clock, middle depth, 6.5 cm from the nipple, there is an oval mass with circumscribed margins, and homogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 0.6 cm AP x 0.4 cm RL x  0.5 cm SI. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase plateau. The enhancement is best seen on series 23,  image 1954. It is also seen on series 2353 image 105. This mass is not hyperintense on T2.
There is retroareolar ductal ectasia with T1 hyperintense signal.
There are a few small left axillary lymph nodes. One level 1 lymph node measures 0.8 x 0.8 x 1.3 cm (series 23 image 1919, series 2353 image 148); there is a small focus of susceptibility artifact at the anterior aspect of this lymph node, presumably from wing shaped biopsy marking clip.
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
