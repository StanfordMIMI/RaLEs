FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with minimal background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts. The right breast is smaller than the left breast, likely due to right post lumpectomy changes.
RIGHT BREAST: There are benign findings of lumpectomy in the upper outer quadrant. There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: 
L1: At 11 o'clock, far posterior depth, 9 cm from the nipple, there is a round mass with irregular margins, and homogeneous internal enhancement, measuring 1.8 AP x 1.9 SI x 1.9 TR cm. This mass is the biopsy-proven invasive ductal carcinoma and is stable in size and appearance comparison to prior exam. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase fast and delayed phase wash-out. The enhancement is best seen on axial peak contrast series 23, image 1912. There is susceptibility within the mass  from a spade shaped biopsy marker. The posterior aspect of the mass is approximately 2 mm from the chest wall without underlying chest wall enhancement.
There is susceptibility from hourglass biopsy marker at 11:00, 6 cm from the nipple, from recent benign MRI guided biopsy with post biopsy changes.
OTHER FINDINGS: There is a right chest port.
