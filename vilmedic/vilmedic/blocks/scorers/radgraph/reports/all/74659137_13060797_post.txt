FINDINGS:
The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with mild background parenchymal enhancement that is symmetric between both breasts.
RIGHT BREAST:
R1: At 11 o'clock, middle depth, 5-6 cm from the nipple, there is heterogenous non-mass enhancement in a focal distribution, measuring 1.0 x 0.4 x 0.7 cm, not significantly changed from comparison. Worst-curve kinetics are initial phase  fast and delayed phase persistent. The enhancement is best seen on axial peak contrast series 25,  image 1964. There is a biopsy marker anterior to this nonmass enhancement from prior benign biopsy.  
There is no additional suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy.
LEFT BREAST: 
L1: There is no residual mass or enhancement in the breast. The prior seen skin thickening and edema has resolved. There is susceptibility from the Cork biopsy marker at 2:00, 4 cm from the nipple. There is susceptibility from the top-hat shaped in a left axillary lymph node. There is no suspicious enhancement or lymphadenopathy
OTHER FINDINGS: None significant.
