FINDINGS: There are two asymmetric left axillary nodes with fatty 
hilums; measuring 15 x 8 mm and 8 x 9 mm in size. In the left breast, 
spanning the entire upper outer quadrant, there is a 5.6 x 6.9 x 4.0 
cm lobulated mass that abuts the chest wall, with associated 
retromammary edema. There is localized subcutaneous and skin edema in 
the area overlying the mass. There is rapid enhancement within the 
mass with a gradually enhancing central core consistent with a 
necrotic center. Elsewhere in the breast there are no other areas 
suggestive of malignancy. 
In the right breast there are no dominant masses, focal areas of 
enhancement or architectural distortion. There are no areas 
suggestive of malignancy.
