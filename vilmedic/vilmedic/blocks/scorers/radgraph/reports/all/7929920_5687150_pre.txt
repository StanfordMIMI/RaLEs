FINDINGS: I concur with the outside report that preliminary images 
reveal a large approximately 2.5 cm left axillary lymph node. 
 
With contrast-enhancement there is an approximately 4 x 2.5 cm 
non-mass-like enhancement in the lateral aspect of the left breast 
centered approximately 6-7 cm from the base of the nipple in the 
1-4:00 o'clock position. This abuts but does not invade the chest 
wall. There is no definite skin invasion. As noted on the preliminary 
report, there is a tiny satellite less than 1-cm anterior to this on 
series 6, image 47. There is a clip artifact on series 6, image 50 
consistent with prior mammographically performed biopsy. Elsewhere in 
both breasts there is patchy enhancement. Overall, the extent of the 
main mass as well as significance of this patch enhancement is a 
little bit difficult to determine, as the temporal resolution of this 
scan is relatively slow. Extent of the most rapidly enhancing 
component, which would be most specific for invasive tumor, is 
difficult to determine. However, no gross abnormalities are noted.
