FINDINGS:
 
Preliminary 3-plane localizer and axial T1-weighted images of the 
breast reveals small bilateral, right greater than left, axillary 
lymph nodes, the largest in the right axilla measuring approximately 
1 0.5-cm, similar to the prior exam.
 
The osseous structures demonstrate diffuse marrow signal abnormality 
with relative sparing of the epiphyses, presumably related to recent 
chemotherapy. A left chest wall Mediport is seen.
 
The breasts are composed of dense tissue with mild background 
enhancement.
 
RIGHT BREAST:
 
In the right breast at the 10 to 12 o'clock position, 4-cm from the 
nipple, in the region of the prior enhancing irregular mass, there is 
decreased size of the mass with residual enhancement, measuring 
1.9-cm in the AP dimension (previously 3.2-cm) with residual 
enhancement extending in the cranial caudal dimension from slice 
locator I-42 to S-10.1.  There is an associated susceptibility 
artifact from a postbiopsy marker in the right breast.  
 
There is also a postbiopsy marker in the upper outer left breast on 
series 9, image 3232. 
 
LEFT BREAST:
 
There are other scattered nonspecific foci of enhancement seen in the 
bilateral breasts.  Otherwise there are no other areas of suspicious 
mass or non-mass enhancement to suggest invasive malignancy.
